<p class="ph2">THE<br />
POISONED PARADISE</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">PROLOGUE</h2>
</div>

<p>The boy was sitting in a corner of the shabby room.
The mother watched him from her pillow.</p>

<p>“What are you doing, dear?”</p>

<p>“Drawing, Mother Lovely.”</p>

<p>“Strange! Always drawing. Did I ever tell you that
your father was an artist?”</p>

<p>The boy looked at her thoughtfully. His eyes were like
her own, dark and velvety; but his sunny hair contrasted
with her black braids.</p>

<p>“No, Mother Lovely. Had I a father?”</p>

<p>“Yes, dearest. He died just before you were born. I
came here hoping that his people, so rich, so proud, would
be glad to see you. But, no, they cannot understand....
We’ll go home together, you and I, to my home.”</p>

<p>“Where is that, Mother?”</p>

<p>“Monaco, the great rock that rises from the sea, where
my family has lived for generations. Listen, little son
... if I should not be able to go with you, you must go
alone. You will find the house where lives my mother, a
plain, quiet house with brown shutters near the Cathedral.
In front four pepper-trees shield it from the sun, and
through the pines one can see the blue glimmer of the
sea....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>“Is it beautiful, my mother?”</p>

<p>“Always beautiful. The people sing from very joy.
In the garden of the Prince, just in front of our house,
there is a broken pillar covered with ivy. Beside it is a
spring where flowers bloom even in summer heat. It was
there we used to meet, your father and I.... Ah! I
have never regretted it, never....”</p>

<p>Her girlish face was as sweet as a flower, but her eyes
held memories too tragic for tears.</p>

<p>Then the door opened and a woman entered with a
masterful air.</p>

<p>“I’m preparin’ yer potion, ma’am. The doctor said
you was to take it at eight o’clock. Come on, sonny, it’s
bedtime. Ma wants to get a good long night.”</p>

<p>The child looked imploringly at his mother. She shook
her head.</p>

<p>“No, dearest, you must do what the lady tells you.
Come, good-night.”</p>

<p>She held him in her arms, kissing him again and again.
“You, too, will be an artist ... but you must be brave,
my little son; for you have a hard, hard life before you.”</p>

<p>Then she let him go, but he turned at the door. “Good-night,
Mother Lovely.”</p>

<p>“Good-night, darling one. Think of what I told you,—of
<i>home</i>....”</p>

<p>She was alone now. Closing her eyes she saw a little <i>U</i>
shaped harbour shielded from the sea. It was as delicate
as a pastel, a placque of sapphire set in pearl. In the
crystal air the red-roofed houses crowded close to it, the
terraced town rose on tip-toe to peer at it. All was glitter
and gleam and radiant beauty. Yet yonder in sombre
contrast rose the Rock, monstrous, moody, mediæval.</p>

<p>Once more she climbed the long steep hill; she crossed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
the sunny square in front of the palace; she passed into
the cool gloom of the narrow streets. Then at last she
stood before the low brown house with its tiny porch and
its four pepper-trees....</p>

<p>Home.... Home. Would she ever see it again?</p>

<p>Moaning, she turned her face to the wall.</p>

THE OUTCAST</h3>
</div>

<h4>1.</h4>

<p class="drop-cap">“THAT you, Margot?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mother.”</p>

<p>“For God’s sake close the door. You don’t think
I break my back gathering wood that you may warm
the wide world.”</p>

<p>There was a scuffle of sabots anxiously retreating.</p>

<p>“Margot!”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mother.”</p>

<p>“You’re not going away again, are you?”</p>

<p>“I....”</p>

<p>“Come here, little toad. I’ve something to say to you.”</p>

<p>Submissively from the shadow of the doorway slipped
a girl. She had twin braids of pale gold hair, and between
them like a wedge, her face showed waxen with
cold.</p>

<p>“’Fraid I’ll eat you?” snapped the woman. “Come
here, near to me. Brought home any money?”</p>

<p>“No, Mother.”</p>

<p>“But I told you to ask.”</p>

<p>“I did not dare. Madame will not pay in advance.
The last time I asked her she almost sent me away.”</p>

<p>“<i>Nom de Dieu!</i> Couldn’t you give her some story?
Your little sister’s sick. There’s no food in the house.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
Your poor mother’s.... Ugh! What a fool I have
for a daughter. So all you’ve brought back’s an empty
stomach. Oh, I could strike you, I could.”</p>

<p>She suited the gesture to the threat, and the girl
arched her slender arms to stave off the blow. But the
woman dropped her hands disgustedly.</p>

<p>“Bah! what’s the use. If I could only make you cry
there’d be some relish in it. But no! I beat you till
my arms ache and never a whimper. That’s your stubborn
nature. You’ll do nothing to please me. Oh, you’re
a stubborn little devil, still as a mouse, obstinate as a
mule. There’s something in you, daughter, I can’t get
at. But I will. I’ll thrash it out of you. You wait.
Not to-night. I’m too tired to-night....”</p>

<p>From the tumbler at her elbow she took a gulp of
cider and brandy, then turned broodingly to the fire.
The sickly flames betrayed the wretchedness of the room,
the gaunt rafters, the floor of beaten earth. On a deal
table lay a clasp knife, and beside it a loaf of bread. The
girl eyed the bread avidly. Then her hand, red and
claw-cold, stole to the knife, while her gaze rested fearfully
on her mother. But the woman no longer heeded.</p>

<p>“What a life!” she was muttering. “What a home!
And to think I’d have been rolling in my auto, and
crackling in silk and satin, if I hadn’t been a fool. That’s
my weak point.... I always wanted to be respectable,
to be married—all that sentimental rot. Well, I’ve made
my bed and I’ve got to lie on it. But it’s hell....”</p>

<p>She stared dismally at her draggled skirts, her coarsely
stockinged feet, her wooden shoes so warped and worn.
Seeing her absorbed, the girl hacked off a piece of bread
and fell to wolfing it. The woman went on, her face
harsh and haggard in the light of the fire:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>“There was the American. Mad about me, he was. If
I’d played my cards right he’d have married me. What
a time he gave me, Paris, Venice, Monte Carlo.... Oh,
Monte Carlo! But he had to go back home at last. His
wife! Told me to wait and he’d get a divorce. Gave me
all the money he had. Nearly five hundred pounds. Believe
me, I was pretty in them days.”</p>

<p>As if for confirmation, she stroked her hollow cheeks.
Tears of self-pity welled in her weary eyes.</p>

<p>“Ah! if I’d known, I would have waited. But there
was Pierre plaguing me to marry him. Told me he’d loved
me since we’d worked together in that hotel in Brighton;
me as bar-maid, him as head-waiter. Mighty nice he used
to look too in his dress suit. He said he’d been left some
money and wanted to go back to the little town where he
was born and buy a pub. So we was married, once in
England and once in France. God! I was particular in
them days.”</p>

<p>She laughed bitterly, and took another gulp of the mixture
in her glass. Her eyes went glassy. Her fingers
clutched unseen things. She maundered on.</p>

<p>“Yes, I was happy there. It was all so new to me.
Then we began to get ambitious. The landlord of the big
hotel died suddenly. It was a great chance for Pierre, but
he had not money enough to take it. There was where I
came in. I gave him my five hundred pounds. Told him
an aunt had left it to me. He believed me. We bought
the hotel and everything seemed to go well. Yes, them were
the happy days.”</p>

<p>A fit of coughing interrupted her. When it was over
she took another drink.</p>

<p>“I don’t know how Pierre got to know about the American.
He was away a month and when he came back he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
was changed. He explained nothing, but he treated me
like dirt. It was that made me take to the drink.”</p>

<p>She was silent awhile. Then....</p>

<p>“He didn’t seem to care about the business any more
and I was drinking too much to care; so we went from
bad to worse. We lost the hotel and went back to the
<i>buvette</i>. Then we lost that too, and he had to take a
waiter’s place. By this time the drink was master of me.
I tried to give it up but it was no use. When Cécile was
born I thought I’d be able to stop, but I was worse than
ever. If he’d only tried to help me! But no, he hated me;
and I began to hate him too. We fought day and night,
like cat and dog. Well, it’s a long, long story, and here’s
the end.”</p>

<p>She threw a withered branch of gorse on the fire. It
blazed up gold as its own May-day bloom. The girl had
climbed on a bench by the high bed and was bending
fondly over.</p>

<p>“Margot!” screamed the woman.</p>

<p>The girl started. In the sudden flare, her face was an
ashen mask of fear.</p>

<p>“What are you doing there?”</p>

<p>“I’m just looking at Cécile, Mother.”</p>

<p>“Come away at once. Haven’t I told you a hundred
times not to go near her? I know you with your sneaking
ways. You want to steal her away from me. She’s the
only one I’ve got left, and I want her to myself,—all, all.
If ever you go near her, I’ll kill you. See!”</p>

<p>A fit of coughing choked her utterance. Again the girl
stole to the door.</p>

<p>“Margot!”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mother.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>“Fetch the bottle of brandy from the cupboard.”</p>

<p>The woman poured herself a stiff glass and downed it
in a gulp.</p>

<p>“Come here, you little imp; I want to look at you.”</p>

<p>She drew the shrinking girl to her. Her lips twitched
with spite.</p>

<p>“His eyes, his mouth, his chin. The very image of him.
And he says you’re not his daughter. Ah! that was the
knife in me. Do you hear, girl? Your father says you’re
not his daughter.”</p>

<p>She laughed harshly, scornfully.</p>

<p>“You’re so much his daughter that I hate you, hate
you!”</p>

<p>The girl had begun to struggle, but the woman was
holding her with spiteful strength.</p>

<p>“Let me tell you something. He came to-day and told
me he was going away for ever. He tried to take Cécile,
but I fought for her, fought like a wild cat to hold her.
You understand?”</p>

<p>The girl winced in her savage grip.</p>

<p>“Hear that. You’ve no father. He disowns you. And
let me tell you something more,—you’ve no mother....
I disown you, too. After to-night I never want to see
you again. You’re the dead image of him and I hate him
too much. Now go!”</p>

<p>She hurled the girl from her and took another gulp of
the neat brandy. The glass dropped from her hand.
She sagged forward.</p>

<p>Except for the crackle of the burning twigs all was
quiet. The girl gathered a hurried armful of clothes.
She was glad to go, but for Cécile!</p>

<p>She stole over to the bed where her sister lay sleeping.
She saw a cluster of golden curls, a wan little face with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
lips parted and lashes that seemed to cast a shadow.
Bending down, she kissed the white cheek. The heavy
lashes stirred, the big blue eyes opened, the child’s silken
arm stole around her neck.</p>

<p>“You’ve come home, Margot?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I’m going away again.”</p>

<p>“Don’t go, Margot. Don’t leave me. I’m afraid of
Mother. Stay with me. Stay with your little Cécile.”</p>

<p>“No, I can’t. Kiss me, dear.”</p>

<p>The child held her so tightly it was difficult to free
herself. Then the mother turned. She shrieked in sudden
fury, and the girl in her terror made a leap for the
door. But the latch jammed; and, the while she was
fumbling with it, the woman made a rush for her.</p>

<p>The girl screamed with fright. The woman, in her
haste, stumbled, caught herself, and with a foul oath
snatched the knife from the table....</p>

<p>That was Margot’s last memory of her mother,—a
harridan hurling curses at her and threatening her
with a naked knife....</p>

<p>Sobbing with terror, she stumbled over the stone
sill of the doorway and gained the sanctuary of the
night.</p>

<h4>2.</h4>

<p>The night had on her robe of carnival, and her spangled
skirts made glorious the sky. The girl halted by
the wayside, where a line of clipped oaks blotted themselves
against the stars. She did not cry, for she had
lost the habit of tears, but drew long sobbing breaths.</p>

<p>The night wore drearily on, the stars seemed to glitter
in cruel unconcern. The girl dozed and dreamed a
little....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span><i>She was a child of four, the happiest and best dressed
in all the village. She had robes of lace, and silk ribbands,
and shoes of satin. Her mother cared for her like a little
princess, and her father carried her proudly in his arms.
Every one said she was spoiled. She had more toys than
all the other children put together. But the most precious
of all was a doll as big as a real baby, a doll that
opened and shut its eyes, and had jointed arms and legs.
She had a dozen dresses for this doll, and spent hours and
hours caring for it....</i></p>

<p><i>She was a girl of ten. She wore a long white robe
and a veil over her head. Some said she looked like a
fairy, some an angel. It was her first Communion, and
of a score of girls she was the prettiest by far. She it was
who headed the shining procession through the long
grey street of the village. The way was strewn with lily
leaves, and child-voices blended sweetly in the June
sunshine....</i></p>

<p>That was her last memory of happiness. Her father
suddenly changed. Where she had known only caresses,
harsh words and bitter looks were now her portion. The
home once so joyful, was the scene of sordid wrangling.
She was allowed to go about shabby and dirty, and became
nothing but a slipshod drudge.</p>

<p>Her father never struck her, but her mother beat her
cruelly. It was a relief when she was apprenticed to the
local dress-maker and spent her day away from the misery
of home. But oh, the nights when she ate her slovenly
supper and waited for the inevitable out-break! When
it came and the storm raged at its height, her father
would retreat with Cécile to the cottage of her grandmother
and leave her to bear the brunt of her mother’s
drunken spite. How often had she been thrashed, how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
often torn from her bed, and flung half-clad into the night!
In the old barn there was a corner where she had many a
time crouched and shivered until dawn. Ah, what bitter
memories! Would any amount of happiness ever efface
them?</p>

<p>So half brooding, half dreaming, the night passed away.
She opened her eyes wide and found she had gained a ridge
not far from a forest. She looked down a billowy slope
of tree-tops to the misty level of the plain. It was a grim
grey world; but even as she gazed, a silver wire seemed
to be drawn along the horizon. The stillness was intense,
a listening, waiting stillness; from the other side of the
sky some god seemed to be pouring over the cloud-fleece a
solution of light.</p>

<p>Then as she looked she saw that the sinister quality of
the light had gone. The silver wire had broadened to a
glint of pearl; slowly it glowed to a pink as delicate as
that of sea-shells. The pink deepened to a rose, kindled
and spread. Waves of colour rippled up the sky, brightening
with every wave. Shade succeeded shade. Rich crimson
battled with cerise and rose with coral pink. Then
suddenly came a leap of gold, the gold of daffodils. It
brimmed into a dazzling flood. It welled and glowed and
spread; and before its radiant lucidity the orgy of colour
melted away. Then into that indomitable light,—a primrose
rim, a golden segment, the sun was launched in all
its glory.</p>

<p>The sunshine and the song of birds gave her courage.
The world began to glitter. Warbling notes came from
the bushes, and dew-drops spangled the thread of gossamer.
In this world, so fresh, so fair, the happenings of
the night before seemed to her an evil dream.</p>

<p>The few peasants she passed gazed at her curiously.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
Over her shoulder was slung her bundle, and her pale,
peaked face between its twin braids of bright hair had all
the entreaty of a beaten dog.</p>

<p>As she trudged wearily on she came to a glade, flooded
with sunshine and perfumed with pine. Bees droned in
the wild thyme, from the fork of a tree a squirrel scolded,
on a hollow oak nearby a wood-pecker drummed sonorously.
And in the midst of this scene of peace an old man
was painting.</p>

<p>He was not a nice old man. His skin was white, the
dead white of an onion, and the girl noted that flies
swarmed round and round him. They settled on his
blouse and walked over his beard but he took no notice
of them. He seemed to attract flies as carrion attracts
them. He gave the girl a contemptuous look.</p>

<p>“Well, what d’ye think of my picture?”</p>

<p>“It’s very pretty, sir.”</p>

<p>“Pretty be damned. Never tell an artist his work’s
pretty.”</p>

<p>The girl was turning away when his voice arrested her.</p>

<p>“Where are you going?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, sir.”</p>

<p>“Why? Haven’t you got a home?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>He turned round and looked at her hard. He seemed
to reflect.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t you like to go to Paris?”</p>

<p>The girl started. Paris! It was the most beautiful,
the most wonderful city in the world. It had been one of
her dreams that some day she might visit it.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” she answered.</p>

<p>“Then, why not?”</p>

<p>“I have no money.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>“Is that the only reason?”</p>

<p>“I have no friends there.”</p>

<p>“You would make friends in time. Why not go?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, sir. I should be afraid. Maybe, I could not
find work.”</p>

<p>“Humph! Perhaps, I could help you to find work.
Come here.”</p>

<p>Timidly she drew near. She did not like him, but she
felt she must obey. The flies were on his shoulders in a
grey cloud. He had a very small mouth, with lips that
were shiny. He moistened these very often with his
tongue. In his ears were wads of pink cotton wool. He
put out a puffy, yellow hand and touched her. He tilted
back her sharp chin. He held one of the thick braids of
her shiny hair.</p>

<p>“Bah! you won’t be much of a model for the figure.
But I might make something of your head. Wait till I
finish my work, and I’ll see what I can do for you.”</p>

<p>There was such an air of command in his tone that again
she felt she must obey. So she sat down on her bundle
and waited patiently. He worked without heeding her,
until a little before noon, when he rose and gathered
together his materials.</p>

<p>“Come now. I’ll go with you to the station.”</p>

<p>Doglike she followed at his heels. The village was about
two miles away. He bought her some bread and chocolate
and a bottle of cheap wine.</p>

<p>“You’re as hungry as a young wolf, eh! Well, you can
eat on the train. Come quickly or you will miss it.”</p>

<p>She went with him to the station. There he gave her
a third class ticket for Paris and a sealed letter.</p>

<p>“Go to the address on the envelope. Go direct. My
housekeeper will make you comfortable.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>Then the train arrived and he looked at her with eyes
that shone curiously.</p>

<p>“You will help Madame Mangepain with the housework
till I come. After that we will see.”</p>

<p>As the train moved off she saw him standing on the
platform, licking his lips and surrounded by a swarm of
flies.</p>

THE MAN ON WHOM FLIES SETTLED</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">TWO o’clock in the morning at the Gare du Montparnasse.
The girl was dazed and weary. She
sat on her bundle in the stale greyness of the
station, waiting anxiously for the dawn. About six
o’clock she ventured forth, and holding her precious envelope
in her hand inquired her way at the corner of
every street.</p>

<p>A morning of exquisite metal, vivid, spacious, resplendent.
As she crossed the Seine by the Pont Royal, the
sky was golden and against it gloomed the twin towers of
Notre Dame. The palaces of the Louvre swam in lovely
light and the Gardens of the Tuileries seemed washed in
yellow wine. Up the long rise of the Champs-Elysées, the
Arc de Triomphe was superbly radiant, its turquoise
heart stillettoed by the glittering lunge of the Luxor
Column.</p>

<p>The girl gazed with awestruck eyes. As she thought of
the sunrise in the forest the violence of the change dulled
her brain. The city amazed and appalled her; but, impelled
by fear, she came at length to the heights of
Montmartre. There before a gloomy house in the Rue
Lepic she paused, her heart beating thickly.</p>

<p>She knocked at the heavy oak-door, timidly at first, then
loudly. She had a sudden fear that there might be no
one there. As she was wondering what she should
do she heard slow, shuffling footsteps, and a withdrawal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
of bolts, then the door opened a little. An old
woman regarded her angrily. She was bent almost double,
and held her head sideways. Her face was hard and
sour. She snarled:</p>

<p>“What are you making all this row for? Couldn’t you
have the patience to wait till I got down?”</p>

<p>The girl presented her letter. The old woman regarded
it suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Who gave you this?”</p>

<p>“The old man who paints in the forest.”</p>

<p>“Ah! Monsieur Frossard. Well, you can’t expect me
to read it without my glasses. Wait there.”</p>

<p>She closed the door, leaving the girl on the step; but
soon she came back, and her face was grimmer than ever.</p>

<p>“Another of ’em. Well, I suppose I must take you in.
He’s quite the philanthropist, Monsieur Frossard. He!
He!”</p>

<p>The old woman preceded her down a long corridor,
her back bent and her feet splayed out. They mounted
a broad flight of stairs, then a narrow one.</p>

<p>“There! that’s your room, and lucky you are to have
it. I’ll warrant a pig-stye is more in your line. You
are a poor bit of skin and bone anyway. Leave your
bundle on the bed and come with me to the kitchen.”</p>

<p>The girl soon fell into the ways of the household. She
rose at five and prepared the coffee. She scrubbed and
rubbed, washed and swept. She did everything but the
cooking and the marketing. The old woman seldom spoke
to her, and forbade her to put a foot out-of-doors.</p>

<p>The house was a private one, with a large studio facing
the north, and a small, weedy garden shut in by high
walls. The girl was allowed to go into the garden, but
its damp melancholy oppressed her. Some headless statues<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
leaned against the mouldering wall. It was very quiet.
She felt as if she were in a prison.</p>

<p>One Sunday morning Monsieur Frossard arrived. For
days before they had been making preparations, dusting
statuettes and bric-à-brac, sweeping in unwonted nooks
and corners. The old woman sidled everywhere like a
crab, with her neck twisted awry, her bent back and large
splay feet in felt slippers. She kept Margot at work,
constantly impressing on her the necessity of pleasing the
Master. So much did she harp on this that the girl looked
forward to the old man’s return almost with dread.</p>

<p>On his arrival he went to his room and retired into his
great four-poster bed. The old woman attended to him,
carrying him specially prepared dishes, and dusty
bottles of wine.</p>

<p>That evening she said to the girl: “Margot, put on
a clean apron and take this plate of peaches up to the
Master.”</p>

<p>Tremblingly the girl obeyed. Monsieur Frossard was
propped up in bed, a skull cap on his head, and a cigar in
his mouth. Around him was the debris of his evening
meal, the carcase of a lobster, some bones of frog-legs,
and a half finished bottle of champagne. As she approached
she was conscious of a strange odour of decay.
The old man looked at her, licking his little slimy lips
while a score of flies buzzed and settled around him. The
pink cotton wool was still in his ears. She wondered if
there was any connection between the cotton wool and
the flies. An odd revulsion seized her, yet she continued
to approach with the fruit.</p>

<p>“<i>Tiens!</i> it’s the little girl I found in the forest. What’s
your name?”</p>

<p>“Margot, Sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>“Come here, Margot, close to me. Let me offer you
a peach.”</p>

<p>The girl, standing with her head bent, refused.</p>

<p>“Ah! you are too timid. We must cure you of that.”</p>

<p>He put out one of his pudgy hands and took hold of
a long bright strand of her hair. The girl raised her
startled blue eyes. The hand on her shining hair made
her think of a toad. She shuddered. The old man’s face
changed; it became hard and cruel.</p>

<p>“Go away,” he said harshly. “I will see you to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Next morning Madame Mangepain said to her:</p>

<p>“The Master wants to see you in the studio.”</p>

<p>The girl went reluctantly. The studio had always
awed her. It was so huge, so rich. There were costly
rugs on the floor and lovely pictures on the wall. The
paintings all bore the signature of Abel Frossard, and
ranged from nudes to landscapes.</p>

<p>The painter, in his velvet cap and dressing-gown, was
sitting before a fresh canvas. He turned heavily and
beckoned her to enter. His manner was bland, even ingratiating.</p>

<p>“Well, Margot, you are commencing this morning your
new career, that of a model.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said the girl meekly.</p>

<p>“You’d better say ‘Yes, Master.’”</p>

<p>“Yes, Master.”</p>

<p>“Now as a model, you may be a success or you may be
a failure. I will do my best to make you a success, but
it will largely depend on yourself. There’s many a woman
to-day with her limousine and her appartement in the
Champs-Elysées who began life as a model. On the other
hand, if you are a failure there is only the street for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
you, the hospital, prison, death ... you understand.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Master.”</p>

<p>“Ah, good! By the way, why were you afraid of me
last night?”</p>

<p>The girl did not answer. She was looking at a fly
that was crawling on the pink cotton wool in his ear.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t be afraid. You’ll never make a success
as a model if you are afraid. Now to work.”</p>

<p>He motioned her to a dais, on which stood a chair that
seemed all curves.</p>

<p>“Sit there and loosen your hair.”</p>

<p>The girl obeyed. It fell in a sheen of gold around her.
He handed her a brush.</p>

<p>“Brush it out so that it is like an aura.”</p>

<p>She did not understand, but brushed and brushed, with
long, sweeping strokes. The old man had forgotten he
was anything but a painter.</p>

<p>“Fine,” he said enthusiastically. “Now raise your
head and look at the statuette above the book case.
There! That’s good. Just hold the position. I will
make a preliminary study to-day.”</p>

<p>The girl sat quite still, and the old man painted intently.
She posed until luncheon, which she ate with
Madame Mangepain in the kitchen, and at two o’clock returned
to the studio and resumed the pose. At five o’clock
the old man laid down his brush and rubbed his hands.</p>

<p>“There! I’ve finished. Come and see it.”</p>

<p>She looked at the beautiful bit of brush work. She
could not believe that this ethereal girl-face with the
eyes so thrillingly blue and the nimbus of bright gold
hair was herself. The old man observed her awe with
satisfaction.</p>

<p>“You like it, eh? Yes, it’s good. A bit idealized.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
Well, it’s nothing to what I will do before I finish. I’ll
make Chabas look to his laurels yet. Ah! your hair! it’s
what inspires me. Tadé Stycka has no better model.
I’ll make your hair famous.”</p>

<p>Turning her to admire it the more, he parted it behind;
then suddenly the girl felt his lips pressed to the
back of her neck. She started as if a serpent had stung
her and put her hand to the place. Again a shudder
passed over her. For a moment a strange look came
into his eyes, then they went cold again, and he laughed
reassuringly.</p>

<p>“Ha! Ha! you mustn’t mind me. It’s purely paternal.
It won’t do you any harm. Now go and get a good supper.
I’ll want you to-morrow. Don’t look at me in
such a frightened way. I’m not an ogre. I won’t eat
you.”</p>

<p>The next day she posed for him again, but this time
he did not attempt to kiss her. He was very authoritative.</p>

<p>“Pull up your sleeves,” he said sharply.</p>

<p>She obeyed. He looked derisively at her skinny arms.</p>

<p>“Now, open your dress and show me your shoulders.
Coil up your hair on your head first.”</p>

<p>Again she obeyed. When he was like this she was not
afraid of him. It was as if there were two men in him,
the artist and the satyr. He was all artist as he continued:</p>

<p>“Humph! You’ll never do. You’re nothing but bones
and green shadows.”</p>

<p>He threw down his palette and walked heavily about
the room.</p>

<p>“Too bad you’re so thin. I feel I could do big things
with you. But I must, I must! We’ll fatten you up if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
it takes a year. Listen, I’m going away to-morrow to
Morocco. I’ll be gone a month. In that time I want
you to get fat. Do nothing, eat lots, read, amuse yourself.
Turn your angles into curves. You hear?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Master.”</p>

<p>“Now, don’t forget. If you’re not round and smooth
by the time I come back, I will have no more use for you.
Then it’s the street. You know what that means. Go!”</p>

<p>She went, and later on she heard him instructing the
housekeeper.</p>

<p>“I’m going to-morrow, Madame Mangepain, to Morocco,
and I want that girl to be plumped up. Fatten
her as you would a chicken. She’s going to be my favourite
model. I can do great things with her. Great things!
Let her do no work. Wait on her. Feed her dainty
dishes. Buy her fine clothes, silks and that sort of thing.
Books too. Don’t let her move about too much. Remember,
it’s for my sake not hers. I rely on you, Madame
Mangepain. And I say, address her as mademoiselle.”</p>

<p>He left next morning and Margot felt a huge sense of
relief. It was as if something corrupt had gone out of
the house. She could not get over this feeling of <i>pourriture</i>
even when she was posing for him in the big studio.
Perhaps his breath was so fetid, that it pervaded every
room he entered.</p>

<p>When he had gone, her life changed completely. Madame
Mangepain said to her at supper:</p>

<p>“Don’t get up to-morrow morning. I’ll bring you your
breakfast in bed.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, madame.”</p>

<p>“I tell you I will. It’s the Master’s orders. I’ve been
told to serve you and I will ... mademoiselle.”</p>

<p>“Oh, please don’t call me mademoiselle.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>“It’s the Master’s orders.”</p>

<p>The next morning the girl remained in bed until the
old woman sidled in with a tray of <i>café au lait</i>, <i>croissants</i>
and fine butter.</p>

<p>“Now stay in bed till I come back.”</p>

<p>The girl heard her go out, locking the door. She returned
an hour later carrying a large parcel containing
a kimono of mauve silk, fine lace underwear, silk stockings,
and velvet shoes.</p>

<p>“There! Put these on. It’s the Master’s orders. And
I’ll go and prepare your bath.”</p>

<p>It must be said that Madame Mangepain entered on
her undertaking with zeal if not with enthusiasm. She
taught the girl the elegancies of the toilette, the care of
her skin, how to point and polish her nails and to
bring to perfection her teeth and her hair. She had
quite a battery of bottles and brushes, of oils and paints
and perfumes. Margot spent every morning in the white-tiled
bathroom, meticulously following the régime that
the old woman demanded of her.</p>

<p>For luncheon, each day she was given dainty dishes
such as she had never dreamed of; then, wrapt in the
mauve kimono and stretched out on the great divan in
the studio amid a pile of cushions, she would read one of
the luridly covered novels the old woman bought for her.
Among them were <i>Chéri-Bebé</i>, <i>Dracula</i> and <i>Les deux
Gosses</i>. These books absorbed her, made her forget her
strange surroundings, which otherwise filled her with a
vague fear. Sometimes she even thought of escape, when
she sat on fine afternoons in the wild unweeded garden
amid the headless statues. By climbing upon one of them
she could have gained the top of the wall and freedom.
But after that ... what? The streets! She had a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
horror of the outer world which the old woman never lost
an opportunity of developing. According to Madame
Mangepain Paris was a merciless ogre, demanding its
daily tribute of a thousand girls such as she, crushing
and devouring them.</p>

<p>One day as she peered through a window into the
street, she saw a girl about her age in a violet blouse with
black, oily hair banged on her forehead, and at her side,
a pale stunted youth with a reckless mouth and eyes cold
as those of a snake. They seemed to be having words.
Suddenly the youth struck the girl, knocking her down;
then snatched a cheap trinket from her throat, and with
a final vicious kick, went off laughing cynically. This
typical scene of apache life made a deep impression on
her.</p>

<p>“It’s all like that,” she thought,—“the life out there.
It’s what will happen to me.”</p>

<p>“Ah, I’ll make a beauty of you yet,” said Madame
Mangepain at the end of the second week. “Monsieur
Frossard won’t know you when he comes back.”</p>

<p>And indeed the girl was amazed at the change in herself.
Her skin had become smooth and velvety, her limbs
round and firm. Her face, too, had changed. It had retained
its quality of childishness, but had lost its cowed
and shrinking look. Hints of sweetness and charm revealed
themselves. If only she could get away, find decent
work, escape from the sinister old man into whose clutches
she had fallen. Every day the dread of his return grew
upon her.</p>

<p>Then one night Monsieur Frossard came back.</p>

<p>When she brought Margot her coffee next morning
Madame Mangepain said to her:</p>

<p>“Get up and make yourself as beautiful as you can.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
Monsieur Frossard wants to see you in the studio. Be
sure you are a credit to me.”</p>

<p>The old woman went so far as to superintend her toilette,
putting a faint flush of rouge high on her cheeks,
and brushing her hair like spun gold down over the mauve
kimono. But nothing could mask the wretchedness in
the depths of the girl’s eyes.</p>

<p>As she stood in the doorway of the studio Monsieur
Frossard turned ponderously.</p>

<p>“<i>Entrez, voyons.</i> Don’t stand there like a Christian
martyr going to the stake. Come here.”</p>

<p>With eyes cast down she obeyed. He pulled up the
sleeve of her kimono and looked at her arm with a critical,
dispassionate gaze.</p>

<p>“<i>Ah, bon.</i> Now do up your hair in the glass and bare
your shoulders. I’m going to do a bust of you to-day.”</p>

<p>Again she obeyed, his eyes following her eagerly.</p>

<p>“Sit on the model’s chair. Bare your breast more.
What are you afraid of, you little fool? Remember, I’m
an artist. I’ve been itching to paint you, itching. I’ve
thought of you all the time I’ve been away. I have a
dozen ideas. I’m going to make you famous.”</p>

<p>A passion almost cruel in its intensity seemed to seize
him. Imperiously he made her hold the pose and painted
with swift sure strokes. He stopped reluctantly for
lunch and bade her hurry and again take the pose. He
worked until the light failed, then laid aside his brush
with a regretful sigh.</p>

<p>“<i>Voila!</i> Come and look at this.”</p>

<p>Again the girl marvelled at what she saw. These curves
of milky shoulders, that slim, silky beauty of neck and
throat, the shell-like ear, the faintly hollow cheek with
its suggestion of pathetic sweetness, and above all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
superb mass of hair,—here glinting with the brightness
of stubble in September sunshine, there richly gold as the
ripened grain. Could this really be she? Frossard might
be a devil, but he painted like an angel.</p>

<p>“I’m tired now,” he said, “I want to rest until dinner.
You’ll take dinner with me in the studio. We’ll celebrate.”</p>

<p>She heard him with a heaviness of heart. All his artistic
fire had left him and he seemed to be very old. More than
ever she was conscious of his odour, and the flies that
followed him everywhere. The joy the sight of her picture
had given her was extinguished. She went away
quickly.</p>

<p>Madame Mangepain served them a dinner that excelled
anything the girl had ever conceived. Margot ate
scarcely at all. Frossard, however, made up for her lack
of appetite. He filled himself with delicious food, washed
down with draughts of Beaunè from a dusty bottle. He
lingered long over the dessert, talking to her of his travels
in Morocco, and looking for all the world, like a bloated,
heavy-eyed pasha.</p>

<p>“Have one of these cigarettes,” he said. “I get them
specially in Cairo.”</p>

<p>The girl refused.</p>

<p>“Then, you must have a glass of this champagne. It’s
quite harmless. You can dip one of those biscuits in it.”</p>

<p>He bade her finish the champagne. It was the first
she had ever tasted and it made her dizzy. The old
man seemed to have grown very vivacious. He was
taking glass after glass, and talking more and more
excitedly. Suddenly he reached out and took hold of her.</p>

<p>Then fear seized her. She struggled to escape, but he
held her tight. All at once she felt his shiny little lips
on her neck, cold as the mouth of the fish called a sucker.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
She had just been reading “<i>Dracula</i>,” a story about
vampires, and the idea flashed into her mind that this old
man was going to bite her neck and suck her blood. She
screamed.</p>

<p>He was panting, and a wild light was in his eyes. “It’s
no use to squeal. Madame Mangepain has gone out.
You are all alone in the house with me.”</p>

<p>Terror gave her strength. With a wrench and a twist
she broke away, leaving the mauve kimono in his hands.
She ran to the door of the studio; but before she reached
it he was after her. He had her again in his arms. Great
strength seemed suddenly to come to him. His eyes
glared, his breath came with a hiss.</p>

<p>“Ah! you won’t escape. I’ll have you. Ach! you
struggle, you little vixen! But your resistance only maddens
me. It’s no use, you’re mine, mine.”</p>

<p>Fighting with all the force that was in her, she was
borne backward, and thrown heavily on the divan. She
saw his face bending over her, his eyes alight, the saliva
drooling from his mouth. Once more she struggled but
he held her with a grip of steel. She felt herself grow
faint. Again and again she shrieked. Oh God! Would
no one come to her aid?</p>

<p>She felt her strength leaving her. All she could see
were his eyes, flaming with cruel lust. How she hated
those eyes. She would destroy them, put out their light,
if it cost the last effort of her life. Wrenching her arms
free she caught his head at the temples, and with a fierce
thrust pushed her small, pointed thumbs into the gloating
eyes. With an oath the man pulled himself free
and struck her down. Then he threw himself on the couch,
screaming, screaming.</p>

<p>She ran to the front door but it was locked. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
rushed up to her room and bolted herself in. She lay
on her bed sobbing hysterically. She heard the sound
of hurried feet, much coming and going. In the silence
that followed Madame Mangepain knocked at her door.</p>

<p>“Open, you little viper.”</p>

<p>The face of Madame Mangepain was cold and deadly
in its fury. “You’ve done it now. You’ve finished the
Master. The doctor says he’ll never see again. He’ll
be blind, do you hear; blind. A great artist, a genius
worth a dozen little trollops like you. Now go, and an
old woman’s curse go with you!”</p>

<p>With that Madame Mangepain took her by the shoulders
and threw her into the street. She heard the door
bang behind her. She was alone in Paris.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER THREE<br />

THE BISTRO ON THE RUE DE BELVILLE</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE crash of the closing door struck a note of
terror in the girl’s heart. It was long after midnight,
and she was at the mercy of this sinister
city. She tripped over a box of ash-pan refuse that stood
on the edge of the pavement; from it ran two large rats.
Afraid to be longer in the unlighted street she made her
way down to the Boulevard de Clichy.</p>

<p>On the Butte another hectic night had ended. In the
cafés the waiters were stacking the tables; the theatres
were dark and silent, the girls of the pavement loitering
homeward with their men. Only from the rakehell
restaurants of the Place Pigalle did there issue sounds of
revelry. It was Montmartre of the profligate, of the
apache. Under the greenish glare of the electric light
the girl cowered, a tiny black shadow in a world of sinister
shadows. Then sinking down on one of the benches
she gave herself up to despair.</p>

<p>Now and again a man addressed her; but she kept her
face hidden in her arched arms and did not answer. She
trembled at every footstep; the hours seemed endless;
she longed for the dawn.</p>

<p>Chilled through she rose and walked on. Two gendarmes
looked curiously at her. She was afraid they
would arrest her, and quickened her steps. She kept
moving until she was exhausted, then she sank down
on another bench.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>Stale and jaded, like a drab after a night of excess the
dawn came in. The sallow light seemed to shudder
up the sky. Already the city gave signs of awakening
to another day. The milk-merchants opened their doors;
boys on bicycles delivered bundles of newspapers; the
bakers took down their shutters. From where she sat,
Margot watched a number of work-girls buy fresh rolls,
then go to a little bar across the way, and eat their
<i>déjeuner</i> of bread and coffee. Soon bells sounded from
neighbouring factories, and the girls hurried away.</p>

<p>From the little bar came a woman. At first Margot
thought she was a dwarf, but a second glance showed her
to be a hunchback. She was very clean and tidy. Her
face had that look of patient suffering so often seen on
the faces of hunchbacks. It was a very kind, sweet face,
but with a certain shrewdness. She nodded to Margot in
a friendly way.</p>

<p>“Well, dearie, things going well?”</p>

<p>The girl looked at her with sad eyes.</p>

<p>“Ah! I see,—in the soup. Well, it arrives to all the
world. One day up, another down. Come and give me
a hand with my shutters. <i>Sapristi!</i> what it is not to have
a man in the business.”</p>

<p>Margot helped the woman to take down the shutters.
Over the shop was painted the sign:</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="bbox">
<p class="center">A LA MÈRE TRANQUILLE,</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>and this sign was repeated on the window and the door.
Inside there was a circular bar lined with zinc; and around
it half a dozen marble-topped tables.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>“Now, come in, dearie,” said the little hunchback.
“I’m just going to sit down to breakfast, and you are
going to join me.”</p>

<p>With that she took the girl by the arm and led her
behind the bar. They had fresh rolls and butter, and
hot fragrant coffee. The girl devoured the food as if
famished and the woman watched her curiously.</p>

<p>“You certainly are hungry, my child,” she observed.
“It’s good to see you eat. You look tired too, as if you
had been out all night. From the country, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>Encouraged by the little woman’s sympathy the girl
told her story. When she had finished the Mère Tranquille
looked at her thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Just so,” she said, “a poor, pretty girl alone in Paris
is about as safe as a young lamb lost among wolves.
You’ll get devoured, my dear, as sure as sure. Look
here, I can see you’re an honest girl. I tell you what.
I need some one to help me here. Come and stay with
me for a while,—at least till you find something better.
You will live with me and help me in the bar. You
shall be at no expense and you can make four or five
francs a day in tips. Will you come?”</p>

<p>“Oh, madame, you don’t know how gladly! Let me
begin work now.”</p>

<p>“No, you’re too tired. You want a good long rest.
Come with me.”</p>

<p>In the little room behind the bar, the Mère Tranquille
arranged a folding bed, and soon the girl was sleeping
soundly.</p>

<p>Thus there began for Margot a life that was strangely
interesting. Except at rush hours the little place was
very quiet, and the work not hard. She quickly got over
her first timidity with the customers and learned to turn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
a deaf ear to their rather crude pleasantries. There was,
too, a certain reserve in her manner that made her more
respected than popular. The little hunchback gave out
that Margot was her niece from the country, and her
stiffness was not resented. Most of the customers were
working people, but there was also a certain backwash
of the underworld. Above the bar was one of those hotels
that have no name. By night its glowing transparency
winked and signalled to the amorous adventurer; by day
it was haunted by yawning girls in greasy dressing gowns,
and by dark cynical men. Towards evening these girls
“put on their beauty,” and unbelievably transformed, sallied
forth; while the men played cards in cafés and
awaited their return.</p>

<p>It was one of these men who took a great fancy to
Margot and tried to dominate her. He was familiarly
known as Popol, and openly boasted that he had already
three girls earning money for him. He, indeed, aspired
to be a sort of leader among his fellows, a Napoleon of
the bullies. His ambition was fostered by the fact that
he was born in the slums of Agaccio, and bore a certain
physical resemblance to the Great Corsican. He was a
stout, stocky fellow, with a large head, clean-shaven,
regular features and a certain cold impressiveness of manner.
There, however, the resemblance ended; for Popol
had close-set eyes as cold and deadly as those of a rattlesnake,
a mouth that twisted cynically, and a nose that
had been broken in a fight.</p>

<p>Popol never quarrelled openly with any one; he had
never been known to draw a knife, yet other men were
afraid of him, and those who offended him met with unexpected
misfortunes. It was even said he was a spy of
the police and did detective work of the dirtier kind. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
had brains, a cunning and subtlety that made him a power
amid his fellows.</p>

<p>With his cynical conception of all women he thought
Margot would be flattered by his favours. One day in
the street he barred her way, accosting her with some
foul banter. She tried to push past him, and escape. He
laughed sneeringly, then, gripping her arms, tried to kiss
her. Filled with a loathing she could not control, she
struck him full in the face. Popol swore vilely and released
her.</p>

<p>It was with ashen cheeks and wildly beating heart that
she regained the little bar. The Mère Tranquille looked
troubled when she heard the story, but pretended to laugh
it off.</p>

<p>“Don’t be alarmed, <i>chérie</i>; I can defend you against a
dozen of these swine. Just treat them like the dirt they
are. Ah! if only I could sell out and retire to the country!
Since my husband died, the business is not what it
used to be. I got an offer last week of fifteen thousand
francs for the good will, but I am holding out for twenty.
That’s what we gave.... It’s curious how we got the
money....”</p>

<p>The Mère Tranquille paused reminiscently, then continued:</p>

<p>“It was at Monte Carlo, where we went for our honeymoon.
Josef would play at the Casino, and on the second
day he came to me: ‘I’ve lost everything but that,’
he said, pressing a hundred franc bill into my hand.</p>

<p>“‘A nice state of affairs,’ I cried indignantly. ‘It’s
just enough to take us back to Paris third class.’</p>

<p>“‘It’s not to take us back to Paris,’ he told me. ‘It’s
make or break. I want you to play with it. Perhaps,
you’ll change the luck.’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>“I knew what he meant and I never have forgiven him
for it. You know, my dear, that any one deformed as
I am, is said to always win at games of chance. Indeed,
when we had stood around the tables I had noticed
people brush up against me and touch my back in passing.
Well, I was so angry with Josef I snatched the money
from him.</p>

<p>“‘I’ll show you,’ I thought. ‘This money will go after
the other. If I don’t lose it, it won’t be my fault.’</p>

<p>“With that I threw it on the first vacant place on the
table nearest my hand. It happened to be rouge. I
wanted to see that money swept away. There were tears
in my eyes, tears of rage. What do you think! Rouge
came. I left everything on the table. Again rouge came.
Josef wanted to take up half the winnings:</p>

<p>“‘No,’ I said vindictively; ‘let it all go.’</p>

<p>“Again rouge came. There were now eight hundred,
francs on the table.</p>

<p>“‘Take it up,’ whispered Josef frantically; ‘It’s more
than I lost.’ But I answered: ‘No, it’s my money. It
stays there.’ For the thought of his exploiting my deformity
still rankled. Well, again I won. This time
Josef was crazy. He tried to take up the money himself,
but I appealed to the croupiers. The <i>chef de table</i>
said: ‘The money is madame’s. I saw her put it down.
Monsieur has no right to touch it.’</p>

<p>“Josef was foaming. He said, ‘But madame is my
wife. What’s hers is mine.’ The <i>chef</i> shrugged his shoulders;
‘Maybe,’ he said, ‘that is the law in France, but here
you are in the Casino of Monte Carlo, and that money is
madame’s.’</p>

<p>“By this time the wheel had spun again. Again rouge.
I had three thousand two hundred francs on the table.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
The crowd began to gather and every one to take sides,
some with my husband, some with me. Meantime the
stake remained. Once more the ball spun round. Rouge!</p>

<p>“I had now six thousand four hundred francs on the
table, four hundred more than the maximum; and I refused
to touch it. I threw the four hundred on the next
division of the table which happened to be impair. Rouge—impair
came up. I simply could not lose, however hard
I tried. People were coming from other tables to watch
us. Josef had gone white as a sheet and was speechless.
He seemed paralyzed. I had now twelve thousand eight
hundred. I could see the croupiers were pleased that I
was winning, for that sort of thing is a great advertisement
for the Casino. I shifted my eight hundred to the
division higher up,—manque, I think, and put the six
bills of a thousand on impair. I had now six thousand
on rouge; six thousand on impair and eight hundred on
manque. Once more the ball spun. This time I myself
was quite excited. I felt my heart beat. The place began
to swim. Then like a person in a dream, I heard the
croupier say:</p>

<p>“‘Twenty-seven, rouge, impair and passe.’</p>

<p>“The spell was broken; I had lost the eight hundred I
had put on manque but I had won the other two. Twenty-four
thousand francs were mine in the space of ten
minutes. I simply fainted....”</p>

<p>“Did you like Monte Carlo?” asked Margot.</p>

<p>“I did and didn’t. It’s a dangerous place, a wicked
place. But, so beautiful! After that experience we came
away. Josef was sick of it and swore he would never
gamble again. We bought this café and here I have
been for fifteen years.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>“It seems to me I should like to go there,” said the
girl dreamily.</p>

<p>“Don’t ever go. It’s no place for poor people. And
yet I have heard there are lots of women who make a
living there.”</p>

<p>The subject dropped, but Margot was strangely interested
and again and again referred to it. Monte Carlo
seemed to her like some strange exquisite jewel glittering
in a setting of sky, sea and mountain. It held her imagination.
It became part of her dreams.</p>

<p>The next time she met Popol her heart beat painfully;
but there was nothing in his face to inspire fear. He was
polite, almost ingratiating.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle, I apologize for my rudeness the other
day. As a peace offering let me beg your acceptance of
this....”</p>

<p>He held out a silver bag, which no doubt he had taken
from one of his wretched girls. Margot shook her
head.</p>

<p>“No, it’s not necessary. I’ll excuse you if you wish,
but I don’t want to accept any present.”</p>

<p>“No? Then will mademoiselle do me the honour to
dine with me this evening?”</p>

<p>“No, I cannot. I am not free.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I will beg madame, your aunt, to release you.”</p>

<p>“Thank you; but you must excuse me. I do not want
to dine with any one.”</p>

<p>He repeated this offer several times. He had never
failed with a girl before and his vanity was stung. From
coaxings he came to threats.</p>

<p>“I’ll get you yet, you little devil, you,” he told her.
“Even if I have to kidnap you, I’ll get you yet.”</p>

<p>There was a deadly certitude about Popol that made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
his threats impressive. Her fear of him became such an
obsession that she would not go outside after dark. She
told the Mère Tranquille she wanted to leave the quarter,
but the hunchback laughed away her fears.</p>

<p>“Wait a little longer, my dear. I expect to sell the
business any day. Then we’ll have a villa in the country.
We will grow our own salads and receive the rector in the
<i>salon</i>. None will dream we ever lived in this <i>pourriture</i>
of Paris.”</p>

<p>“You will take me with you, madame?”</p>

<p>“Yes, you shall be my adopted daughter. Then I will
marry you to the village butcher and you shall have a
lovely little daughter called Denise, after me.”</p>

<p>The girl made a grimace. “I don’t want to marry a
butcher.”</p>

<p>“Fastidious one! Whom do you want to marry?”</p>

<p>“A poet.”</p>

<p>“Sentimental little fool! I suppose you’re thinking of
that Florent Garnier who comes here and spends so much
time staring at you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, madame! He never looks at me!”</p>

<p>“You think so. Sly one! Why, my dear, he’s head
over heels in love with you. A good-for-nothing socialist,
too. Take my advice, Poulette, love’s all very well, but
it’s money that counts in the long run.”</p>

<p>Margot had indeed an unexpected ally in Florent Garnier.
He was tall, strong, and dark, a carpenter by
trade. Every day he took his after-dinner coffee in the
bar. There he would sit quietly reading a book and
smoking cigarettes. One day he said to her:</p>

<p>“Listen, Margot. If that dog of a Popol tries to molest
you, let me know. I’ll do him up; make a hospital
case of him. See!”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>“Oh, no! I wouldn’t like you to have any trouble on
my account.”</p>

<p>“Trouble! An exquisite pleasure. Look here, Margot....
Won’t you come with me to the cinema some night?”</p>

<p>“No, thank you. I never go out with any one.”</p>

<p>“I know you don’t. That’s why I ask you. Well, I
won’t press you. You may change your mind. In any
case, I’m watching, and if you need a protector I’m here.”</p>

<p>The girl was touched, but at the same time embarrassed.
She did not care enough for Garnier to be more than a
comrade to him, and something told her this would be
difficult. He could not comprehend that coldness of temperament,
which was her English heritage, and made her
able to be friendly with a man while keeping a barrier between
them. Garnier was from the south, romantic, hotblooded.
He would never be able to understand. She
decided to keep him at a distance, though she liked him
immensely.</p>

<p>The conflict between him and Popol came sooner than
she expected. There was a big strike of the carpenters,
and Florent Garnier was an executive. Though he
was very busy addressing meetings and spent most of his
time at the <i>Bourse du Travail</i>, nevertheless he often came
into the bar to rest for half an hour over a cup of
coffee.</p>

<p>It was on an afternoon in early Spring. Madame had
gone out and Margot was alone behind the bar. In a
dusky corner Florent Garnier sat silent. He looked tired
and worried. The strike was not going well. The patrons
were getting outside labour; something had to be done.</p>

<p>Everything was bright and shining. The zinc counter
was polished to look like silver, the glasses to resemble
crystal. Outside there was a flutter of green leaves and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
the chirping of sparrows. It was a year since Margot
had come to Paris. On the whole it had been a happy
year. As an education it had been priceless. Now she
knew the city and its perils and was armoured against
its temptations. She was equipped to fight the battle.
She was feeling unusually gay and sang as she waited for
customers.</p>

<p>Popol entered. “Ha! mademoiselle. You are alone.
You may give me a <i>picon citron</i>.”</p>

<p>While she was pouring it out he caught her hand. Angrily
she wrenched it away.</p>

<p>“Ah! my pretty one,” he sneered. “When are you going
to be my sweetheart?”</p>

<p>The exclamation of disgust was no sooner out of her
mouth than Florent Garnier was on his feet. He came
forward deliberately, and lifting the glass dashed the dark
liquor in Popol’s face.</p>

<p>For a moment Popol drew back. He wiped his eyes,
and glared with surprise and rage; he fumbled at his
belt, and made a swift dart at Garnier. But the powerful
artizan was prepared. Swinging a chair round his head
he brought it crashing down. Popol crumpled up and lay
still.</p>

<p>“Did you see him?” said Garnier coolly. “The dog had
a knife in his hand; he would have stuck me. He has got
his medicine. Leave him alone. He’ll come round. I’ll
take his knife though.”</p>

<p>When Popol got up, he did not seem much the worse;
but his yellow face was convulsed and he was as vindictive
as poison.</p>

<p>“I’ll fix you yet,” he cried. “I’ll pay you both with
interest, you and your lover. And before many days are
over. Look out!”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>“Did you hear him?” said Garnier when Popol had gone.</p>

<p>“Yes. He frightens me terribly.”</p>

<p>“You needn’t fear. You heard him call me your lover.
Listen, Margot ... let me be your lover, your husband.
You need some one to protect you. I tell you we’ll be happy....”</p>

<p>“I know, Florent. I’ve thought of it a lot, but I can’t.—I
like you.—There’s none I like so well—But I don’t
love you. Wait awhile. I’ll try to love you. I really
will....”</p>

<p>Garnier went sadly away, and some days passed without
his returning. Margot became anxious. Then one
afternoon Popol entered. Fortunately the Mère Tranquille
was in the bar with her.</p>

<p>“Ha! Ha!” said Popol. “He’s been arrested, that
pig of a sweetheart of yours. Interfering with the
strikebreakers. It’s to me he owes it, too. He’ll get a
year sure. And I haven’t finished yet. It’s your turn
next time.”</p>

<p>“Get out of this,” cried madame, “or I’ll smash your
face with a bottle.” She brandished one ready to throw,
and Popol with another exultant laugh backed out of the
door.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t be afraid of him,” said the Mère Tranquille.</p>

<p>“I am,—dreadfully. I want to go away. I really do.”</p>

<p>“I tell you he shan’t harm a hair of your head.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t only that, madame. You’ve been so good to
me.... I’ll never forget it, but I feel I have been here
long enough. I don’t like it,—the drinking, the men,—I
want to be quiet. Before I came to Paris I was learning
dress-making. I want to go back to that, to live in a
world of women, and make a living by my needle.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>“I quite understand,” said the Mère Tranquille.
“Listen, my little Margot. I’ve really come to love you
like a daughter. You’ve changed so wonderfully since
you came here. You’ve learnt to laugh, to sing. I’ve
seen the woman dawning in you.... It’s finished, I’ve
sold out at last. I’m taking a little cottage in Normandy
and you’re coming with me. I’m lonely. I want you.
You shall be my daughter.”</p>

<p>“Can it be true?”</p>

<p>“Yes. In another month it will all be arranged. Then
no more Paris. The blessed, green country, peace, comfort.
I want you to take care of me. I have been tired
lately,—my heart. In another month,—say you’ll come,
Margot?”</p>

<p>“It seems like a dream.”</p>

<p>“You’ll come?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes! Would that it were to-morrow.”</p>

<p>The two mingled their tears of happiness and from that
day spent their time in making plans for the future. The
cottage was to have a great garden, with apple and pear
trees. They would keep rabbits and chickens. How
blessed the country seemed; how hateful the city!</p>

<p>“Margot,” said the Mère Tranquille one day. “Go out
this afternoon and buy some clothes for the country.
Here! take this bill of a hundred francs. Just think of
it! In another week we’ll be there.”</p>

<p>The girl did think of it and it filled her with happiness.
Yet all the time she was going the round of the big shops
she had a curious foreboding that was realized as she
returned to the shabby street. Something was wrong;
the little bar was closed, and a crowd hung around the
door.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>A gendarme looked at her indifferently.</p>

<p>“It’s the patronne. She dropped dead quite suddenly.
Her heart they say....”</p>

<p>As she stared in a dazed fashion at the crowd, she
saw the yellow face of Popol. Terror filled her and she
shrank away. Slipping into her room by the back
door, she bundled her few things into a bag and
stealthily left the house.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER FOUR<br />


THE BATTLE OF LIFE</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">SHE found a little room in that quarter of Paris
known as the <i>Nation</i>. It was bright and high, and
open to the sky. During the year she had worked
in the bar she had saved a few hundred francs, and had
no immediate anxiety about the future. She decided that
for a month she would rest and make some new under-linen,
of which she was sadly in need.</p>

<p>It was a very happy month for her. She was fond of
solitude and loved to dream. Sometimes she passed the
long afternoons in the Parc de Vincennes close to the
water. As she sewed she would watch the children at
their play. A sweet emotion thrilled her. She pretended
that she was preparing her trousseau. Who was bridegroom
to be? Ah! she could not imagine.</p>

<p>All along her street were makers of furniture, and the
sight of their workshops made her think of Florent Garnier.
Poor fellow! He had been given six months. She
had read all about it in “<i>Humanité</i>.”</p>

<p>In these long sunny days she often wondered and worried
about Cécile. At last she wrote to her grandmother.
The old woman, who could not use a pen, replied through
a neighbour that her mother had gone to London taking
the little girl with her. That settled the matter. Margot
gave up all hope of seeing her sister again.</p>

<p>As the weeks passed, and her nerves were tranquilized by
the sweetness of her life, she began to lose her fear of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
Popol. He became more and more an evil dream. Once
even she mustered up courage enough to go back to the
little bar. A fat red-faced man served her with a <i>petit
noir</i>. He did not recognize her, and a new sense of security
filled her.</p>

<p>Then one day as she sat sewing in the Place de la Nation
close to the fountain, she had a violent fright. Suddenly
a voice behind her rose to an exultant cry:</p>

<p>“Well! Well! Here you are. I’ve found you at last.”</p>

<p>She turned sharply. A man was looking at her in an
ecstasy of admiration. He was a tubby, rosy little man,
distinguished only by a waxed moustache and a white
waistcoat. He was waltzing around her, and rubbing his
hands excitedly. Yet she was convinced she had never
seen him before.</p>

<p>“Sit still, sit still, mademoiselle,” he cried. “<i>Sapristi!</i>
I’ve been looking all over Paris for you. Allow me to introduce
myself.”</p>

<p>Instead of a card he handed her a small bottle. It
contained a pink liquid, and on its label she read wonderingly:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="bbox">
<p class="center">Bruneau’s Brilliant Balm.</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>“That’s it,” said the little man delightedly. “‘B.B.B.’
Hit ’em hard with the ‘B.’ I’m Bruneau. It’s my invention.
The finest hair lotion in the world.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t want it,” protested Margot.</p>

<p>“No, but it wants you. I want you. Got to have you.
I want you to advertise the Balm. Sit with your back to
the window; hair down, all shining and brushed out. Bottles
of the Balm arranged all about you. Crowds in front<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
of the window all the time. My place is on the Rue de
Rivoli. Come on, let’s come to terms.”</p>

<p>“But, I don’t want to do that.”</p>

<p>“My dear, there’s nothing to do. You just sit there
from ten till twelve and from two till five. You can sew,
you can read if you like. No one will see your face.
You can forget there’s a crowd watching you. It’s a soft
thing, and I’ll pay you better than if you were doing real
work. Come now, twenty francs a day. You really have
no right to refuse.”</p>

<p>“No,” she thought, “I have no right to refuse.” Then
aloud, “Very well, I’ll try it.”</p>

<p>The following day she went to the hair-dresser’s shop
and put herself in the delighted hands of Monsieur Bruneau.
The little man considered himself an artist, as
every man should, however humble his vocation. He arranged
Margot’s hair with reverence, washing, perfuming,
and brushing it until it was like a mantle of spun gold.</p>

<p>When she took her place in the window, he placed
a small mirror so that she could see all the faces in the
crowd without being seen herself. This amused her. She
never wearied of watching the thousands of admiring eyes
she saw reflected daily in the mirror. It gave her a sense
of pride, of elation. Over her was placed a placard which
read:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="bbox">
<p class="center">The most beautiful hair in Paris.<br />
The result of using<br />
Bruneau’s Brilliant Balm.</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>As the days went by the little man with the waistcoat
became more and more enraptured. The Balm was selling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
so fast that he could not have it bottled quickly
enough. He was obliged to extend his laboratory, as he
called the back shop where it was prepared, and employ
a traveller selling it to the wholesale trade. He had also
an advertising contract with the newspapers. Then quite
suddenly he lost his demonstrator.</p>

<p>Margot was gazing idly at her little mirror, when she
saw a face there that seemed to stop the beating of her
heart. It was a hairless yellow face, with rattlesnake
eyes. It was a cruel, cunning face set in a malignant
grin, the face of the hunter who has tracked his prey—Popol!</p>

<p>As she left the shop he was waiting for her and walked
along with her.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you going to take me home with you?” he
asked.</p>

<p>She stopped. “Are you ever going to leave me alone?”</p>

<p>“No,” he sneered, “I’ve been to too much trouble to
find you. Listen, little one. I want you. I’ve always
wanted you since you stood me off. Now I’m going to
have you. No use your struggling. Popol always gets
what he wants. If I can’t get you by fair means, I’ll get
you by foul. With my pals I’ll carry you off some night.
You are all alone now, no one to defend you. If you make
any trouble, I’ll simply kill you.”</p>

<p>“Will you leave me? If you don’t stop talking to me,
I’ll appeal to this <i>sergent de ville</i>.”</p>

<p>She went up to the policeman; he listened to her, twisting
a huge moustache that sprouted from a very red
face.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry, mademoiselle,” he said finally, “the monsieur
only wants to be amiable.” Yet, he waved a warning
hand at Popol.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>Popol crossed to the other side of the street and Margot
hurried on. But no matter how fast she walked, how
many sharp turns she took or how many side streets she
entered, Popol was always there. How could she get rid
of him? Just as she was at her wit’s end she found herself
at an entrance of the Métro. Quick as a flash she
darted down the steps.</p>

<p>A train was at the station and she jumped into a first
class carriage. The sliding door closed; she had given
him the slip.</p>

<p>But at the next station he got into her coach. He had
caught the last of the second class carriages. He grinned
at her from the other side of the compartment, but did
not speak. She despaired of being able to shake him off;
she was helpless.</p>

<p>When they stopped at the next station she was
standing close to the door; near her was a white-haired
old gentleman with the Legion of Honour in his button
hole. As the train was starting again, she suddenly cried:</p>

<p>“<i>Mon Dieu!</i> it’s my station. Let me get off.”</p>

<p>The automatic doors were already closing but the old
man held them back. “Quick, madame.” She slipped between
them and they shut behind her like a trap. She
was safe on the platform. She saw Popol make frantic
efforts to get off and an irate official who was only too
glad of an opportunity to assert his authority, push him
back. As the train glided into the tunnel she had a parting
glimpse of his face snarling with rage.</p>

<p>She took a return train and hurried home. She could
not go back to Bruneau’s, she decided, but must seek
other work. The next morning she did not stir from the
house, and about midday the little hair-dresser called,
anxiety written on his face. He begged, he coaxed; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
to all his entreaties she was deaf; he went away disconsolate.</p>

<p>She had been working for nearly two months and had
saved over five hundred francs. She could afford to wait
a few days before looking for something else to do. She
felt very happy, very safe up her six flights of stairs.
Very much like a bird, so near the sky! She sang in the
sunshine. Taking her work she seated herself at the window
and looked down into the street. Then quickly she
shrank back. There on the opposite pavement was Popol.
He was looking up and had seen her. Fool that she
was to think she could evade him. Of course he had got
her address at the hair-dresser’s. There was no escaping
him. At least she would make another attempt. That
night, seeing that the coast was clear, she hurried to
the Gare de Lyon and took a ticket for a station selected
at random. It turned out to be a remote village in
the Jura.</p>

<p>Every morning she awakened to the mellow sound of
cow-bells, and standing at her window breathed the pure,
delicious air. Beyond the mountain was Switzerland. She
longed to go further, to travel. If ever she had money
enough she would go to the south, to the sunshine, to
Monte Carlo. She would try her luck. Perhaps she
would be as successful as the Mère Tranquille had been.
When her money came to an end, she returned to Paris
with memories of huge green valleys, of crystal brooks,
and of deep solemn pine woods.</p>

<p>The next year was a very hard and checkered one. She
first got a place in the workshop of a big dress-maker,—Plumeau’s.
She had not been there long when one
evening Monsieur Plumeau called her into his private
office. He was a white-haired old man, very well-dressed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
He told her politely that it was the privilege of his prettiest
employées to dine with him occasionally. He called
the directress.</p>

<p>“Select for Mademoiselle a robe that suits her,” he
then said to the girl. “We will have dinner to-night at
the Café de Paris.” He seemed to take it for granted she
would accept, and was quite amazed when she walked out
with head held high. He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“So much the worse,” he said. “Dismiss her.”</p>

<p>Margot was given an envelope with her week’s pay and
told to look for another place.</p>

<p>It was more difficult to find this time, for she had no
reference from Plumeau’s. She was forced finally to seek
employment in a great barrack-like building that employed
three thousand girls. It was the workshop of one
of the great stores on the Boulevard Haussmann, and was
conducted with military severity. Her hours were from
eight in the morning until a quarter past six in the evening.
The work was hard and monotonous; the pay just
enough to cover her simple living expenses.</p>

<p>For long months she slaved with her needle, never
getting ahead. She became shabby, tired, faint-hearted.
When her holiday of ten days came around she had not
enough money to go away and spent the time in her room.
There were girls around her coquettishly dressed,
with men who waited for them every evening. That was
all right; nobody minded a girl having an <i>ami</i> who helped
her. There were some, however, more elegantly clad
who were considered scarcely respectable. Of such a one
it was whispered: “<i>Elle fait sa tappe sur le Boulevard</i>.”
Margot made no friends amongst the other girls and
was always alone.</p>

<p>So passed a year; then to her delight she got a position<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
with a milliner on the Boulevard Saint Michel. Over the
door was the name, “Folette.” Everybody stopped to
look at the window, her hats were so dainty, so daring.
She was renowned for her <i>chic</i>, and even sober men whose
interests were far removed from feminine millinery,
stopped and stared at her latest creations. Below the
shop was the workshop. The girls sat on either side of
a long table with boxes of feathers, ribbands, flowers beside
them. They sewed, pieced, and basted, chattering
happily the while. From time to time Madame Folette
would descend to criticise and give suggestions; she encouraged
them to develop their own ideas, to be creative.</p>

<p>The girl had been there eighteen months, when, one
day, Madame Folette descended to the <i>atelier</i>.</p>

<p>“Margot, I want to speak to you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, madame.”</p>

<p>“How would you like to serve in the shop? I want a
saleswoman to assist me. You have learnt all there is to
learn in the making of hats. You should now learn to
sell them.”</p>

<p>“Madame is too kind.”</p>

<p>“Not at all. I have chosen you, because you are the
prettiest girl in the <i>atelier</i>. You have the most beautiful
hair I ever saw. You will buy a nice-fitting black-silk
dress, black-silk stockings and little slippers of black
patent leather. Black will show off your soft complexion
and your pale gold hair.”</p>

<p>Margot hastened to express her joy and the change was
made. By day she dusted and arranged the stock and
waited on the customers in the white panelled little shop
usually flooded with sunshine. She was very happy. At
night she returned to her tiny room under the mansarde
of a house on the Boulevard du Montparnasse. Her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
window opened on a small balcony where she grew sweet
peas and nasturtiums. She had a gay canary that came
out of its cage and hopped on her finger. She cooked
dainty dishes in snowy enamel ware. It was quite a
radiant little interior.</p>

<p>She was more than usually happy one Sunday, and
sang as she dressed. She had an engagement with a girl
called Jeanne, who was <i>premier</i> at the <i>atelier</i> of Madame
Folette. The two had decided to take a little shop
on the Boulevard below, and start in business for themselves.
Jeanne was a steady, clever girl who thoroughly
understood the running of a workshop. She was to make
the hats, Margot to sell them. They had savings
enough to start. Margot was thinking over their plans
and singing happily when the laundress arrived with her
week’s washing. As she took it from the parcel she
noticed an odour of phenol.</p>

<p>“What a horrid smell,” she thought. Then she changed
the sheets on her bed, and went off forgetting all about it.</p>

<p>The week passed as usual, but towards its end Margot
began to feel strangely tired. She struggled with her
growing fatigue for two days, then Madame Folette said
to her:</p>

<p>“Margot, you’re looking ghastly. What’s the matter?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, madame. I am so cold I shiver all the
time.”</p>

<p>“You had better go home and go to bed.”</p>

<p>“Very well, madame. No doubt I will be better to-morrow.”</p>

<p>On the morrow Margot was worse, and within two days
she had to ask the concierge to call the doctor. He looked
a little puzzled when he examined her, but prescribed a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
treatment, and said he would call again later. On his
third visit a curious red rash covered her.</p>

<p>“Hum!” he said, “I’m afraid it’s scarlet fever.”</p>

<p>On his next visit he was still more puzzled and asked
her many searching questions. He went away looking
very serious indeed. All that day Margot waited,
anxious and unhappy. The red spots developed in the
strangest manner. When the doctor returned late at
night and saw them something like a shudder passed
over him. He drew on his gloves hastily.</p>

<p>“There’s nothing to do, mademoiselle. I am going to
the Institute Pasteur. They will send an ambulance first
thing in the morning. You are lucky that I can get you
in. You will get better attention there than anywhere
else.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?”</p>

<p>“You mustn’t worry. It is most unfortunate. It must
have been those clothes from the laundry. I am going
straight to the police. Please wait patiently till the ambulance
comes. Don’t be alarmed.”</p>

<p>“But, doctor, tell me, for the love of God! What have
I got?”</p>

<p>He looked around as if to be sure there were no listeners,
then said slowly:</p>

<p>“My poor girl, I may be mistaken but I think it’s....”</p>

<p>She gazed at him with eyes that were strained with
horror.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, doctor, don’t tell me it’s <i>that</i>....” she
gasped.</p>

<p>But the physician had gone and she fell back on her
bed. She was dazed. It was unthinkable. Then as her
mind began to grasp the truth, despair fell on her.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s cruel,” she moaned. “I have worked so hard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
and kept honest, yet everything goes against me. I ask
so little, yet always when I am about to better myself,
something terrible happens. Oh, Life, Life! You’re hard
on me ... you’re hurting me so....”</p>

<p>What was the use of struggling? She would let herself
die. If only she had some veronal she would take a fatal
dose....</p>

<p>“But, no,” she cried, courage coming back to her.
“I’ve fought all along and I’ll die fighting. I’ll laugh
to the end.... I will be the victor....”</p>

<p>Worn out she sank into a troubled sleep.</p>

<p>When she woke it was to hear her little clock strike
two. How long the night was! Would the dawn never
come? The dawn with the ambulance! What was that
about an ambulance? No, it was all a dream, an evil
dream—what the doctor had told her. She would sleep
again. She was so tired, so tired....</p>

<p>Was that something moving out in the hall? The
house was very quiet. What strange fancies she had.
She must be going mad.... Was that fancy again?—that
noise outside? And there ... her door was opening
very softly. No, she was not mad. It was really
moving. With straining eyes she watched.... A dark
form filled the doorway, and a man’s figure slipped into
the room. She stifled a scream of terror.</p>

<p>Her chamber was lit by a small night-lamp turned very
low, but she knew only too well that large yellow, hairless
face. Popol! This was another of these evil dreams.
Then she heard him speak.</p>

<p>“Well, my pretty one, at last.”</p>

<p>He looked at her, his face full of gloating triumph. He
locked the door, and gave a chuckling laugh.</p>

<p>“Now I’ve got you, my chicken. Ha! Ha! no one gets<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
away from Popol. He’s sure, is Popol. Once he gets
on the trail he never gives up. It’s been a long trail,
my beauty, but now....”</p>

<p>Suddenly his voice grew thick with fury.</p>

<p>“Now I’ll teach you who’s your master. You’ll be
glad to kiss my dirty boots before I’ve done with you.
Ah, you needn’t squeal for help. No one will hear you;
I’ve planned well. I have taken the room next to
yours. Been there since Saturday. There are no other
neighbours, and the people in the flat below are in the
country. You are absolutely at my mercy,—in my
power.”</p>

<p>He was in no hurry. From behind his ear he took
a cigarette and lit it at the little night-lamp. The girl
watched him, fascinated as a bird is by a snake. He enjoyed
her terror, and prolonged it. Then passion seized
him. He gripped her by the arm. At last she found her
voice.</p>

<p>“No, no,” she gasped. “Spare me. Have pity. I will
give you all the money I have. Here! Take this!”</p>

<p>From under her pillow she drew her purse and thrust
it at him. He snatched it with a laugh, looked inside, and
put it carefully in his pocket.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” he jeered; “I expect you’ll make
lots more for me in days to come. Yes, I’ll have your
money, and, by God, I’ll have you too....”</p>

<p>With a leap he had her in his powerful grip and the
struggle began. He held her arms so that she could not
move them, and pressed his coarse lips to her face. At
their touch madness seized her. She bit fiercely into the
flabby fold of his cheek. With a snarl of pain he released
her.</p>

<p>“You little devil, I’ll kill you for this.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>Once more he sprang at her, held her down. She felt
her strength leave her. She could resist no more. She
was fainting.... Then suddenly she remembered....</p>

<p>“Stop!” she cried; “Stop for your own sake! Can’t
you see I’m ill? Can’t you see what is the matter?”</p>

<p>Something in her voice arrested him. He drew back.
There was a long tense pause. Slowly he turned up the
light. Then ... he grew limp with terror. He looked
closely and shrank back.</p>

<p>“No, no,” he gasped hoarsely. “Not that?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that!” she screamed. “And now you’ll have it
too. Oh, brute, brute! You can kill me if you like. I
have had my revenge. They’re coming with the ambulance,
coming even now. You hear, it’s the <i>smallpox</i>,
you dog! The smallpox....”</p>

<p>But Popol did not want to kill her. Gazing at her
with horror-stricken eyes he backed to the door.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she exulted, “You can kiss me now. It will
make more sure, or rather see.... I am coming to kiss
you.”</p>

<p>She made a move as if to rise and follow him but he
did not wait. He reeled through the door, pulling it to
behind him. She heard him stumbling down the dark
narrow stairs, blubbering like a child.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s awful,” he cried. “I can’t stand it. I’m not
a sound man. It will kill me. It will kill me.”</p>

<p>And Popol was right. It did.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER FIVE<br />


PHANTOM FORTUNE</h3>
</div>

<h4>1.</h4>

<p class="drop-cap2">AS she shrank back into the remote corner of the
first class compartment, Margot sighed profoundly.
She had been thinking of the strange
events of the past month and of the bewildering turn in
her fortunes.</p>

<p>When she had been released from the hospital, some
three months before, she was still very weak. During her
illness a religious sisterhood had nursed her with devotion;
a famous physician had personally attended her; a
great Institute had exhausted its skill in her behalf. She
was a record case, they said,—not a trace of the disease
showed. She wanted to return to Folette’s and begin
work at once, but Madame would not hear of it. “No,
my dear, you’re too shaky. You need a good long rest
in the country, two months at least. If you have no
money I will lend you some.”</p>

<p>So Margot borrowed five hundred francs and went to
Barbizon. There in a cottage on the edge of the forest,
she slowly regained her strength. Then she returned
to Paris.</p>

<p>One afternoon, a few days before she had arranged to
return to the <i>modiste’s</i>, she decided she would like to visit
the grave of the Mère Tranquille. Once more she sought
the little bar on the Rue du Belville. As she entered she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
had a curious feeling that she had never been away; the fat
red-faced man was still reading a paper behind the zinc
counter. When she asked where her old friend was buried,
he put down his paper and stared at her.</p>

<p>“You don’t happen to be the girl who worked here?”</p>

<p>“Yes, monsieur.”</p>

<p>“Margot Leblanc?”</p>

<p>“The same, I assure you.”</p>

<p>The fat man brought down his fist with a thump on
the counter.</p>

<p>“<i>Sapristi!</i> Why, every one thinks you are dead. The
lawyers sought you high and low; you seemed to have
vanished off the earth. Didn’t you know the old woman
left you a heritage?”</p>

<p>“No. Is it true?”</p>

<p>“Assuredly. Not much; but to a girl like you, it will
be very welcome. Here, I’ll give you the address of the
lawyers and you can go and see them at once.”</p>

<p>She lost no time. The result was that in due course
she received her legacy. After settling all expenses and
paying every debt, she found herself the possessor of a
little over three thousand francs. Never before had she
owned anything like such an amount. To her it seemed
riches. At first she thought she would carry out her plan
of taking a little shop with Jeanne. But the winter
was coming on, the cold, grey, cruel winter; time enough
for the little shop in the spring. A sudden distaste for
Paris possessed her. Then one day as she was passing
the window of a tourist agency she stopped to stare at
a vivid poster depicting a sea of turquoise blue, a terraced
town that seemed carved from ivory, a background
of amethystine mountain, palms, pigeons, gorgeous
flowers. Underneath was the name—<i>Monte Carlo</i>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
It came like an inspiration; she would go there. With a
sense of great daring she packed her basket-valise, said
good-bye to Madame Folette and Jeanne, and took the
train.</p>


<h4>2.</h4>

<p>As she sat alone in the corner of her compartment,
these events passed through her mind and she sighed
deeply. She felt very lonely, rather frightened. She
blamed herself for having bought a first class ticket at
Marseilles, but the journey in the crowded second class
from Paris had so fatigued her that she had decided to
be extravagant.</p>

<p>Even in her jaded state the scenery seemed to her to be
of dreamlike beauty. It was not until Nice had been
reached that its too exorbitant claims on her admiration
began to weary her. They must be very close now. It
was long, that journey, especially when one has been so
ill. She must tidy up a bit. She rose and began to arrange
her hair, that stupid hair of which she had so much.
It tumbled turbulently down and she had to take out all
her hair-pins and let it fall around her like a golden
shower. As she looked up apprehensively, she saw a
young man staring at her from the corridor. She was
vexed. She caught the mutinous tresses hurriedly and
bunched them around her head. When she had finished
with her pins and combs, she looked around again. The
young man had gone.</p>

<p>She liked the <i>Pension</i> which had been recommended
to her, because every one left her alone. The first day
she gave to exploring the gardens and getting her bearings;
the second she presented herself at the Casino and
asked for a card. Fortunately, she had been warned that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
on no account must she divulge the fact that she worked.
It is significant that a woman who earns her living
honestly is refused admission to the Casino while a
prostitute is welcomed. The administration knows that
the small wage-earner brings little grist to their mill,
while the demi-mondaine plays their game. Margot filled
in her application with the usual phrase: “<i>Sans occupation</i>.”</p>

<p>Although she had made up her mind to gamble she was
more than prudent. For the first week she did nothing
but watch the tables with concentrated attention; then
she bought a note-book with shiny covers and began to
take down numbers. She would stand by a table for two
or three hours, until her column of figures was quite a
long one. Then, finding a quiet seat in the Café de Paris,
she would sip a cup of chocolate and study them. She
felt encouraged by the fact that a number of women, with
negligible capital, were undoubtedly making a living at
the Casino. Shabby, anxious creatures she saw them hovering
like hawks over the tables, waiting to get in on “a
safe thing,” and going away finally with a few pieces of
gain. They had lived thus for years.</p>

<p>“Surely,” she thought, “with two thousand francs of
capital, I can win a louis a day.”</p>

<p>The next step was to make up her mind how she would
play. She must adopt a method, and concentrate on it.
After long reflection she decided that the most cautious
way of playing was to stake on two of the three
dozens. In this way she would only have one dozen
against her. From the examination of her figures, and the
columns of permanencies published in a paper whose
colour was the green of hope, she found that the first
dozen seemed to come a little less frequently than the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
other two, and that it had a greater tendency to repeat.
Here was a hint for her. She would wait until the
first dozen had asserted itself strongly, then, as it were,
retired exhausted. She would put five francs on the second
and five francs on the third dozen. She would be
covering thus twenty-four of the thirty-six numbers. If
either of her two dozens won, she would receive fifteen
francs, a gain of five francs. As soon as she had won four
times, and had made a louis, she would stop. She furthermore
decided that she would always play a flat stake, and
would never make a progression. In the long run a progression
was always fatal. If she lost a louis on any one
day, she would stop for that day and not court disaster
by trying to retrieve her losses.</p>

<p>As she pressed through the crowd and put her first
stake on the table, she felt her heart beat wildly. She
thought every one was watching her.</p>

<p>“Here is a new one,” she imagined them saying. “Another
poor little chicken come to be plucked. Look how
her hand trembles as she puts her two white counters on
the table. One would imagine she was playing for thousands.”</p>

<p>But after all every one was absorbed in the game, and
no one paid any attention to her. The ball spun around.
She had won.</p>

<p>“Ah!” she thought, “it is always specially arranged
that the beginner wins.”</p>

<p>And she played again with more confidence. The player
has the advantage over the bank in that he may select
his moment of play. (Unfortunately he generally selects
the wrong moment.) Margot waited for what seemed to
her a favourable moment and staked again. Again she
won. Her second and third coups were equally successful.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
She was strangely elated, far more so than the extent of
her gain really warranted. She had been excited and
anxious before, now a happy reaction set in. She changed
the white counters she had gained for a twenty franc bill,
which she regarded with a rare pleasure. How strange
to make money so easily! Playing as prudently as this it
did not seem possible to lose. Just think! if she had only
played with louis-stakes instead of five franc ones....
Or even with hundred franc placques.... A sudden
vision of fortune dazzled her. “If....” Ah! that pregnant
“if” that gamblers use in victory and defeat. The
tragedy of that “if.” The virus was already in her veins,
and she went home to dream of whirring roulette wheels
and the smiles of fortune.</p>

<p>She awaited the second day with a passion of eagerness.
But alas! things did not go so well. When she had
made three wins she had a loss. With chagrin she watched
her two pieces swept away. She was now only one ahead.
She won her next three coups, however, and retired with
her louis of gain.</p>

<p>The third day she had a hard fight. It was as if the
Casino had said: “Tut! Tut! we must not let this slip
of a girl get our money so easily. We must begin to
baulk her a bit.”</p>

<p>She played all morning and afternoon, winning and
losing, and winning again. Try as she would, she could
not get them to give her a louis. At seven o’clock she
retired from the fight, only a poor five francs the winner.
She was fearfully tired, her head ached, and the smile of
fortune seemed transformed into the wryest of grins.</p>

<p>The fourth day she had no trouble and her confidence
came back. But the fifth ... the first dozen came up
seven times running and broke to the third. By all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
laws of average it was due to rest a bit and allow the
equilibrium to establish itself. It was, therefore, with a
confidence almost insolent, that the girl staked on the
second and third dozen. She was so sure of winning that
she felt as if the money were already in her hands, and
did not even wait to watch the spinning wheel. She
had reached down to secure her winnings when to her
surprise she saw both her stakes being raked in. The
number two had declared itself.</p>

<p>Next time it would come right, and again she staked
on the second and third dozen. She waited almost listlessly.
To her dismay she saw her stakes swept off a
second time. There must be a mistake.... No,
the ball was resting in the slot marked twelve.</p>

<p>She sat down on one of the leather-padded lounges. It
was not the money she had lost that worried her, but the
fact that her system had proven untrustworthy. She
hated to be beaten like that. A mixture of resentment
and anger dominated her,—a mood most dangerous to a
gambler. She rose, and going back to the table put one
louis on the second dozen and another on the third. She
won. She had regained all that she had lost.</p>

<p>She did not play any more that day. She went to the
Café de Paris, and, having ordered a jug of chocolate,
sat down to think. It was evident that to gain four
straight wins every day, was too great a strain on her
system. Well, then, instead of playing four coups with
five francs each time, why not play a single coup with a
louis for the stake? In this way she would not tire herself
out with long play, nor exhaust her luck. Accordingly
the next day she began playing on these lines.</p>

<p>For a time all went well. She found that with average<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
luck she won three times out of four. Then a spell of
bad luck set in, and in spite of the care with which she
played she found her gains were reduced to two out of
three. This left her no profit. She must do something to
raise her average. She thought the matter over. If she
had to have a certain proportion of losses, why not let
them be fictitious ones? Why not let her losses be made
with imaginary stakes and her gains with real ones? She
made up her mind that, playing with her usual care, she
would wait until she had lost twice in her head, before
playing on the table a third time for a win. It needed
lots of patience; often she had to wait for two hours
before her chance came, but with this method she won
three times out of four. However to develop a system in
theory and put it into practice are two very different
things. To play a system one must be as emotionless
as a machine; systems make no allowance for human
passion and impulse, and this she soon found to her cost.</p>

<p>It happened one day that, when she went to the Rooms
in the afternoon, she staked as usual a louis on the second
and another on the third dozen, after having watched the
wheel for awhile. The number eleven came up. Now according
to her system she should have called her day a
loss and gone home. But on this particular afternoon her
mood was mutinous. She determined to try again. She
re-staked in the same fashion, and the eleven repeated.
She was furious with herself for being so weak and foolish.
It would take her four days to regain her losses. It was
too tedious, too discouraging. Well, it could not be
helped now. She walked to the door, but just as she
reached it she hesitated. Her irritation grew. No, she
would <i>not</i> let them beat her. Going back to the table<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
she fumbled in her bag and drew forth two notes of a
hundred francs each. She handed them to the croupier.</p>

<p>“Second and third dozen, please.”</p>

<p>She was strangely calm now, but she could not bear
to see the ball spin. She turned and went to another
table, pretending to watch the play there. She forbade
herself to look back, then when she heard the ball drop,
she glanced round. The croupiers were cleaning up the
tables, but the rake swung clear of the hundred francs
she had put on the middle dozen. She had won.</p>

<p>Again she snatched victory from defeat. She had retrieved
her losses and had a louis to boot. But strange
to say she felt no elation. She had been reckless and
risked two hundred francs. It must not happen again,
she told herself.</p>

<p>It was soon evident that if her average wins were
three out of four, with a stake of two louis, and she made
only one coup, her gains would only aggregate five
francs a day. That would never do. After much reflection
and analysis of her figures, she decided to play
with placques of a hundred francs each. In this way she
would gain a hundred francs every four days; and even,
if she allowed five francs for a possible zero every time
she played, she would still make her louis a day. This
was the plan she finally adopted. Her system, in short,
was to play only a flat stake, never a progression. She
played only one coup a day, stopping if she lost, and took
two fictitious losses before actually playing on the table.
She played a hundred francs on the second, and a hundred
francs on the third dozen after an exhausted run of
the first dozen. She put five francs on zero.</p>

<p>It was very much like hard work, and needed both patience
and judgment, but it was possible for her to go on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
playing this system for six months without mishap, and
in the end just about even up.</p>


<h4>3.</h4>

<p>One day as she was eating a hurried luncheon she noticed
a young man reading by the window. His hair was
ash blonde, brushed glossily back, his face thin, sensitive,
and browned by the sun. When he smiled at Terese,
the waitress, his teeth were milk-white, and very regular.
His eyes should have been blue, but were of a dark, velvety
brown. An extraordinary good-looking boy, she thought,
with an air of refinement, of race. He looked up and
caught her eye; immediately she looked down.</p>

<p>She had seen him before, she fancied, but where? Then
she remembered the young man who had stared at her in
the train. It was strange she should meet him again.</p>

<p>She saw him often afterwards in the gardens, walking
hatless, with his head held high. He never went to the
Casino, and seemed very gay and happy. It was easy to
see he was well off, and had not a care in the world. Once
he passed her as she was on her way to her room, but
shyness came over her and she did not glance at him.
He looked so proud; he must be at least the son of an
English lord. Why then should she, daughter of a
French head-waiter and an English bar-maid, be even on
bowing terms with him?</p>

<p>Then something happened that quite drove him out of
her thoughts. For ten days she had been playing her
system without even a loss, gaining nearly a thousand
francs. Her winnings so far had more than paid her modest
expenses. When she entered the Casino on Christmas
morning she had four bills of a thousand francs each in her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
bag. She had also a letter from Jeanne. Jeanne knew
of such a nice little shop on the Boulevard Raspail. It
would be empty by the January term and, if Margot was
willing, they would each put in two thousand francs and
take it. Jeanne wanted an answer at once. Margot was
very happy. She would tell Jeanne to take the shop, and
she herself would return to Paris shortly after the beginning
of the new year. She was sorry to think of leaving
Monte Carlo, and to give up roulette; the keen shifts and
stresses of the game intrigued her and she loved that moment
of emotion just before the ball dropped. Then the
thought came to her: Why not experience a moment of
more intense emotion than she had ever known? She had
a thousand francs of the bank’s money that she did not
absolutely need. Why not risk it? If she could win
with bills of a hundred, why not with notes of a thousand?
She watched the table until the opportunity came. She
placed five hundred francs on the second dozen, and five
hundred on the third, then with an air of unconcern fell
to regarding one of the pictures on the wall. It was a
painting of Watteau-like delicacy, representing autumn;
falling leaves, gallants and ladies of the court....</p>

<p class="center">“<i>Rien ne va plus.</i>”</p>

<p>Would the ball never drop? She heard it knocking about
among the diamond-shaped brass projections. Then silence,
and ... zero.</p>

<p>Oh, what a fool she had been! For the first time in
weeks she had forgotten to cover zero. And for the first
time in weeks she had encountered it. She hated the calm
croupier who raked in her thousand francs. There was
something so ruthless, so inexorable in the way he did it.
A dull rage filled her. She seemed to be impelled by
something stronger than herself. She took from her bag<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
a second note of a thousand francs and played it as before.
No, she would not stake on zero. The chances of
it repeating were a thousand to one.... <i>Zero!</i> again!</p>

<p>It could not be possible! As she saw another thousand
swept away she felt physically sick. She sat down on a
lounge, dazed, stunned. The impassive croupiers seemed
suddenly to become mocking satyrs, the great guilded hall,
pitiless, cruel. She watched a little hunch-backed
croupier spin the wheel by its brass handle; he flipped
the ivory sphere in the other direction in a careless,
casual manner. The girl started up. It was as if she
were an automaton, moved by some force outside of
her will. Taking a third thousand franc bill from
her bag, she staked it in the same way as before. No use
to stake on zero this time. The chance of its coming up
a third time was a million to one. She saw the ball go
scuttling among the brass knobs; she heard a great murmur
from the gazing crowd; all eyes turned admiringly
to the little hunchback who tried to look as if he had
done it on purpose.... ZERO!</p>

<p>She walked away. A bitter recklessness had seized her.
She took out her remaining thousand franc bill. She
would risk it anywhere, anyhow. A red haired man was
coming in at the door. That was an inspiration. She
would play on the red and leave it for a <i>paroli</i>. She went
over to the nearest croupier and handed him her bill.</p>

<p>“Rouge, please.”</p>

<p>But the croupier misunderstood. He put the bill on
black, looking at her for approval. After all, what did
it matter? Let it remain on black. She nodded and
black it was. Once more the ball whizzed dizzily round
and dropped into its slot. Rouge.</p>

<p>She had lost. In less than four minutes she had lost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
four thousand francs. She pulled down her veil and
walked out of the gambling rooms. Her legs were weak
under her and she felt faint. She sat down on a bench in
the atrium. It could not be true! She must have dreamt
it. She opened her hand-bag of shabby black leather
and searched feverishly. All she found was about thirty
francs.</p>

<p>She was broke.</p>

DERELICT</h3>
</div>

<h4>1.</h4>

<p class="drop-cap">THEN began the great struggle of Margot Leblanc
to regain the money she had lost. It was a
pitiable, pathetic struggle, full of desperate hope.
Starting with ten francs, she sought to win back the two
thousand needed to buy the shop with Jeanne. She kept
her room at the pension, but gave up taking her meals
there. Instead she had a cup of coffee and a roll in a
cheap café in the Condamine. She would do without sleep,
she told herself; she would be shabby and shiver with cold
... but she would win back that money!</p>

<p>Every morning she took her place among that weird
and shabby mob of women who storm the Casino doors at
opening time, and scramble for places at the tables,
hoping to sell them in the afternoon to some prosperous
player. The Casino, which had been the cause of their
ruin, lets them thus eke out a miserable existence. Threadbare
creatures with vulturish faces, they hang over the
tables, quick-clawed to clutch up the stakes of the unwary.</p>

<p>Margot was glad of every opportunity to make a little
money by selling her place. It meant the price of a
square meal: spaghetti, and salad and cheese, in a cheap
Italian restaurant in Beausoleil. Otherwise, when an increasing
dizziness warned her that she had not yet broken
her fast, she had to seek a quiet corner of the gardens,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
and lunch on a bit of chocolate and some bread. Then
she would hurry back to the Casino, fearful that in her
absence a chance had come up to make a few francs.</p>

<p>It was a weary, anxious existence. Sometimes indeed
she got down to her last five francs before a sudden turn
of luck exalted her again to the heights of hope. The
effect on her nerves was terrible. Her nights became
haunted. Roulette wheels whirled before her closed eyes
and she often dreamed of a mighty one that turned into
a great whirlpool, in which she and all the other players
were spinning around helplessly. And always, just as
she was being sucked down into the vortex, she awoke.</p>


<h4>2.</h4>

<p>One evening as she sat in a corner of the gardens,
silent and absorbed, a man approached her. He was dark
and weedy, and his eyebrows twitched up and down continually.
She recognized him as one of her fellow-lodgers
at the pension, and she had heard him addressed as Monsieur
Martel. After looking sharply at her, he took a
seat by her side.</p>

<p>“Had any luck lately?” he asked with that freemasonry
of gamblers that permits of a promiscuous conversation.</p>

<p>Silently she shook her head.</p>

<p>He lighted a cigarette. “It’s a cruel game,” he observed.
“God help the poor pikers who haven’t enough
capital to defend themselves. I had a hard fight to-day.
I was obliged to play a martingale up to five thousand
francs, all to win a wretched louis. But I got out all
right. I imagine you have not been very successful yourself
lately. I have seen you losing.”</p>

<p>She nodded. He drew comfortably nearer.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>“Well, that’s too bad. By the way, if I can be of any
help to you, give you any advice.... I have a considerable
knowledge of the game....”</p>

<p>She laughed bitterly. “I, too, Monsieur, have a considerable
knowledge of the game. But there ... that
is all the capital I have in the world, ten francs.”</p>

<p>She held out two white chips in her shabby, gloved hand.
He noted the smallness of the hand, and the glimpse of
milk-white wrist between the glove and the threadbare
jacket. He drew nearer still.</p>

<p>“Ah! it’s hopeless,” he said, “when one gets down so
low. Why not let me make you a loan? I shall never
miss it. You can repay me out of your winnings. Let
me lend you a trifle, say five hundred.”</p>

<p>She looked at him steadily for a moment. “But I have
no security to give you,” she said at last.</p>

<p>He laughed easily. “Oh, that doesn’t matter. Of
course, we are speaking as one Monte Carloite to another.
We understand each other. If I am nice to you, you will
be nice to me. My room at the pension is number fourteen.
If you come down and see me this evening I have
no doubt we can arrange matters.”</p>

<p>She rose. In the shadow he could not see the loathing
in her eyes. These men ... they were all alike. Beasts!
She left him without a word.</p>

<p>He waited in his room that night, wondering if she
would come. She did not. He went off to the Casino
laughing comfortably. Life was a great game.</p>

<p>“If it isn’t to-night,” he said to himself, “it will be to-morrow
or the day after. A little more hunger, a little
more despair. I have but to wait. She will come to me.
If she doesn’t, what matter? There are lots of others.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span></p>


<h4>3.</h4>

<p>Some days later she sat in her room staring at her
face in the cheap mirror. There were dark circles around
her weary eyes. Her cheeks were thinned to pathetic
hollows, her mouth drooped with despair and defeat.
The Casino had beaten her. She was sick, weak,
nervously unstrung. Try as she would she could not get
back her old healthy view of life; that was the worst of
it. Gambling had poisoned the very blood in her veins.</p>

<p>She had no money to take her back to Paris, even if
she were willing to go, and she felt she would rather die
than write and ask for help. Then to take up the burden
of labour again, the life of struggle without hope and with
misery to crown it all, ... Ah! she knew it so well. She
had seen too many of her comrades fight and fall. Must
she too work as they worked, until her strength was exhausted
and she perished in poverty?</p>

<p>There was death, of course! Only last week a young
girl, after pawning all her trinkets, shot herself under
the railway bridge. She would do better than that; she
had some little white powders.</p>

<p>Then there was the compromise. Why not? Who
under the circumstances would dare to tell her that death
was better than dishonour? And yet ... she hated to
think of doing it. She preferred to steal. Funny, wasn’t
it? Her sense of morality was curious. She would rather
be a thief than a harlot.</p>

<p>But she had no chance to be a thief. It would have to
be the other thing. Rising she put rouge on her ghastly
cheeks then rubbed it off again. No, not just yet! She
would ask the young man for the five hundred francs. If
he demanded the <i>quid pro quo</i> she would beg him to wait<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
until to-morrow. Then she would go to the Casino and
risk all. If she won she would return him his money, and
say she had changed her mind. If she lost ... well,
there was the white powder....</p>

<p>She would ask him at once. How dark and silent the
house was. Room fourteen was on the floor below. Softly
she crept down the shabby stairs. She had to put on her
cloak; she shivered so.</p>

<p>That was his door. She hesitated, inclined to turn
back. Perhaps he had gone out. Her heart was beating
horribly and the hand she put out trembled. She knocked.
There was no answer. Softly she tried the handle of the
door.</p>

THE UNHAPPIEST LAD IN LONDON</h3>
</div>

<h4>1.</h4>

<p class="drop-cap">THE woman he used to call aunty kept a rooming
house on Balmoral Circus, and the boy’s earliest
memories were of domestic drudgery. He cleaned
boots until nearly midnight, smudging with grimy
knuckles his sleepy eyes. He slept in a cupboard at the
rear of the hall, along with dirty brushes, smelly dusters
and lymphatic cock-roaches. As he grew taller he learned
to make beds and to take care of the rooms. Aunty
nagged at him continually and he had to dodge occasional
blows.</p>

<p>She was an unwieldy woman with a tart tongue and
tight varnished hair. Every afternoon she would put on
a battered bonnet and go forth for what she called “a
breff of fresh air.” She would return about five, smelling
of gin and very affable. He preferred her cuffs to her
kisses.</p>

<p>Uncle would come home at a quarter past six. He
was a French-cleaner, a monosyllabic man who loved his
pipe. One evening he broke his stoic silence.</p>

<p>“Missis, it’s time that boy ’ad some schoolin’.”</p>

<p>“Schoolin’! the ideer! And tell me ’oo’s goin’ to do the
work of this ’ouse while he’s wastin’ ’is time over a lot o’
useless ’istry an’ jography?”</p>

<p>“I tell you, missis, he’s got to have some eddication.
He’s goin’ on for nine now and knows next to nothin’.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>“Well, you know wot it means. It means payin’ some
lazy slut of a ’ouse-maid sixteen bob a month.”</p>

<p>“Well, and why can’t you pay it out of that five ’undred
pounds ’is mother gave you to look after ’im?”</p>

<p>“’Eaven ’ear the man! And ’aven’t I looked after ’im?
’Aven’t I earned all she gave me? ’Aven’t I bin a second
muvver to ’im? Didn’t I nurse ’er like a sister, and ’er
dyin’ of consumption? There ain’t many ’as would ’ave
done wot I did.”</p>

<p>The difficulty of his education, however, was solved by
the second-floor back, Miss Pingley, who undertook to give
him lessons for two hours every day. She was the cousin
of a clergyman and excessively genteel, so that his manners
improved under her care.</p>

<p>Once he began to read his imagination was awakened.
More than ever he hated the sordid life around him. He
began to think seriously of running away, and would no
doubt have done so, had not Uncle again intervened. One
evening the silent man laid down his pipe.</p>

<p>“I’ve got a job for the boy, Missis. He begins work on
Monday.”</p>

<p>“Wot!”</p>

<p>“I say get a gel for the work. That lad’s goin’ into
business on Monday.”</p>

<p>“Well, I never!”</p>

<p>“Yes, Gummage and Meek, the cheese people. You ’ear,
Hugh?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Uncle. Thank you, Uncle.”</p>

<p>Aunty began to make a fuss, but Uncle promptly told
her to shut up. As for the boy the thought of getting
away from dust pans and slop pails was like heaven to
him; so the following Monday, with beating heart, he
presented himself at the office of Gummage and Meek.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span></p>


<h4>2.</h4>

<p>Mr. Ainger, the cashier, sat on his high stool, and
looked down at a slim lad, twisting a shabby cap. Mr.
Ainger was a tall man of about fifty, his hair grey, his
face fine and distinguished. It was said that in his spare
time he wrote.</p>

<p>“Well, my boy,” he said kindly, “what do you call
yourself?”</p>

<p>“Hugh Kildair.”</p>

<p>The gaze of Mr. Ainger became interested. He noted
the dark eyes that contrasted so effectively with the light
wavy hair, the sensitive features, the fine face stamped
with race. Centuries of selection, he thought, had gone
to the making of that face.</p>

<p>“A romantic name. So, my boy, you are making a
start with us. I don’t know that it’s what you would
choose if you had any say in the matter. Probably, you’d
rather have been a corsair or a cowboy. I know I would
at your age. However, very few of us are lucky enough
to do the things we’d like to do. Life’s a rotten muddle,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, my young friend, I do not know if the horizon
of your ambition is bounded by cheese, if it inspires you
with passion, with enthusiasm. Still you might have made
a worse choice. You might have been in oils and varnishes,
for instance, or soap. Imagine handling those
compared with that exquisite ivory curd—transmuted by
bovine magic from the dew and daisies of the field. I tell
you there’s romance in cheese; there’s even poetry. I’m
sure a most charming book could be written about it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
Pardon me, but you’re not by any chance thinking of
writing a book about cheese, are you?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Glad to hear it. Now I think of it I might as well do
it myself,—a whimsical Belloc-sort of book with glimpses
of many lands. But there. Let us return to the subject
of your future. All I can say is: Do your best; we’ll do
the rest. Now go; and believe me, our discriminating
gaze is upon you.”</p>

<p>In the years that followed, although he saw little of
Mr. Ainger, he was conscious of a protective and sympathetic
eye. As for the work he did not dislike it. It was
pleasant in the cool gloom of the warehouse where cheeses
of all shapes and colours made strange lights and shadows.
He had more liberty too, than he would have had in the
office. He was able to make pen and ink sketches of his
companions in his spare moments. At the end of
every month he handed over his pay to Aunty who returned
him a trifle for pocket-money.</p>

<p>At the beginning of his fifth year his salary was raised
to fifty pounds. On the day he received his first instalment
he did not return to Balmoral Circus. Instead he
went to a small room in Hammersmith, carrying his few
belongings in a cricket bag. He then wrote to Aunty,
saying he was “on his own,” and he would never see her
again.</p>

<p>At last, at last he was free.</p>


<h4>3.</h4>

<p>How hard that first winter was! Fifty pounds went
much further in those days than it does now, but even
then he had to go without many needful things. An overcoat,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
for one. You can picture him a tall, thin pale
youth, with a woollen comforter and a shabby suit far too
small for him. He was often cold and hungry. A cough
bothered him.</p>

<p>One day Mr. Ainger came down to see him.</p>

<p>“Hullo, young man. You haven’t written that book
yet?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“I am surprised. Assailed as you are by a dozen pungent
odours do you not realize that under the cork-trees
of Corsica the goats browse on the wild thyme in order
that those shelves may be replenished with green veined
Roquefort; that cattle bells jingle in the high vivid valleys
of the Jura to make for us those grind-stone like
masses of cavernous Gruyère; sitting here are you not
conscious of a rhythm running through it all, of a dignity,
even of an epic—cheese?”</p>

<p>“Well,” he went on, “I’ve come to hale you from all
this source of inspiration to a more sordid environment.
There’s a spare stool in the counting-house I think you
might ornament.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be glad of a change, sir.”</p>

<p>“Good. By the way, where are you living?”</p>

<p>“Hammersmith, sir.”</p>

<p>“Ah, indeed, I have a cottage on the river. You must
come and see me.”</p>

<p>A fortnight later he took Hugh to his little villa. It
was the only real home the lad had even seen, and was
a revelation to him. Mrs. Ainger was the first sweet
woman he had ever met, and he immediately worshipped
her. There were two fine boys and a most fascinating
library.</p>

<p>The Aingers had a great influence on Hugh’s development.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
Through them he met a number of nice fellows
and instinctively picked up their manners. He played
football, cricket, and tennis,—at which games he was swift
and graceful, but somewhat lacking in stamina. He
studied French, and Mr. Ainger was at great pains to
see that he had a good accent. But best of all, he was
able to attend an art school in the evenings and satisfy
a growing passion for painting.</p>

<p>Then the war broke out. He went to France with the
First Hundred Thousand. In the wet and cold of the
trenches he contracted pneumonia and his recovery was
slow. As soon as he was well again, he was transferred
to the transport service and drove a camion in the last
great struggle. When he was demobilized he returned to
the office at a comfortable salary.</p>

<p>Everything looked well now, everything but his health.
He suffered from a chronic cold and was nearly always
tired.</p>

<p>Then one raw day in early Spring he saw a poor woman
throw her child over the Embankment.</p>

<p>“She was quite close to me,” he told Mr. Ainger afterwards,
“so of course I went in. It was instinctive. Any
other chap would have done the same.</p>

<p>“Well, I grabbed the kid and the kid grabbed me, and
there I was treading water desperately. But it was hard
to keep afloat; and I thought we must both go down. I remember
I felt sorry for the little beast. I didn’t care a
hang for myself. Then just as I was about to give up,
they lifted us into a boat. There was a crowd and
cheering, but I was too sick to care. Some one took me
home in a taxi and my landlady put me to bed.”</p>

<p>The chill that resulted affected his lungs. All winter
he had fits of coughing that made him faint from sheer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
exhaustion. He awoke at night bathed in cold sweat.
In the morning he was ghastly, and rose only by a dogged
effort. One forenoon, after a hard fit of coughing Mr.
Ainger said to him:</p>

<p>“Cold doesn’t seem to improve.”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“By the way, ever had any lung trouble in your
family?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. My mother, I’ve been told, died of it.”</p>

<p>“Look here, take the afternoon off and see our doctor.”</p>

<p>The doctor was a little bald, rosy man. He looked up
at Hugh’s nigh six feet of gaunt weariness.</p>

<p>“You’re not fit to be out, sir. Go home at once. I’ll
see you there.”</p>

<p>So Hugh went to his bed, and remained in it all summer.</p>


<h4>4.</h4>

<p>One day in late October he lay on his bed staring drearily
at the soiled ceiling, and wondering if in all London
there was a lad more unhappy than he.</p>

<p>“A lunger,” he thought bitterly. “Rotten timber! A
burden to myself and others. Soon I must take up the
fight again and I’m tired, tired. I want to rest, do nothing
for a year or two. Well, I won’t give in. I’ll put
up a good scrap yet. I’ll——”</p>

<p>Here a knock came at the door. It was the little doctor
cheery and twinkling.</p>

<p>“Hullo! How’s the health to-day?”</p>

<p>“Better, doctor; I’ll soon be able to go back to the
office.”</p>

<p>The doctor laughed: “If you remain in London another
six months you’ll be a dead man.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>“What would you have me do?”</p>

<p>“Go away. Live in a warm climate. Egypt, Algeria,
the Riviera.”</p>

<p>“And if I go away how long will I live?”</p>

<p>“Oh, probably sixty years.”</p>

<p>“Quite a difference. Well, doctor, I expect I’ll have to
stick it out here. You see, I’ve no money, no friends.
Even now I’m living on the charity of the firm. They’ve
been awfully decent, but I can’t expect them to go on
much longer.”</p>

<p>“Have you no relatives?”</p>

<p>“None that I know of. I’m absolutely alone in the
world.”</p>

<p>“Well, well! We’ll see about it. Surely something can
be done. Don’t get down-hearted. Everything will come
out all right.”</p>

<p>The little doctor went away, and Hugh continued to
stare at the soiled ceiling. There came to him a desperate
vision of palms and sunshine. But that was not for him.
He must stay in this raw bleak London and perish as
many a young chap had perished....</p>

<p>Next morning came another knock at the door. It was
Mr. Ainger.</p>

<p>“Well, my lad, how are you feeling?”</p>

<p>“A little better. I hope I’ll soon be able to get back to
my ledger.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, my boy! You’ll never come back. You’re
expected to hand in your resignation. The doctor holds
out no hope. You can’t go on drawing on your salary
indefinitely.”</p>

<p>Hugh swallowed hard. “No, that’s right. You’ve
treated me square. I can’t complain.”</p>

<p>“Complain, I should say not; look here....”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>With that Mr. Ainger took from his pocket a sheaf of
crisp Bank of England notes and began to spread them
out on the bed.</p>

<p>“Twelve of them. Ten pounds each. All yours. We
collected sixty pounds in the office and the firm doubled it.
And now you’re going to eternal sunshine, to blue skies,
to a land where people are merry and sing the whole
day long. You’ve escaped the slimy clutch of commerce.
Gad! I envy you!”</p>

<p>“Do you really, sir?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I wanted to live in Italy, Greece, Spain; to roam,
to be a vagabond, to be free. But I married, had children,
became a slave chained to the oar. One thing though,—my
boys will never be square pegs in round holes. They’ll
have the chance I never had.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it’s not too late.”</p>

<p>“No, perhaps not. Perhaps some day I’ll join you
down there. Perhaps when I get things settled, I’ll live
under those careless skies where living is rapture. I’ll
get back by own soul. I’ll write that book, I’ve tried all
my life to write. Perhaps ... it’s my dream, my
dream....”</p>

<p>Mr. Ainger turned abruptly and went out, leaving
Hugh staring incredulously at the counterpane of notes
that covered his bed.</p>

THE CALL OF THE BLOOD</h3>
</div>

<h4>1.</h4>

<p class="drop-cap">PINES packed the vast valley, climbing raggedly to
the pale grey peaks. Sometimes the mountains
swooped down in gulch and butte of fantastic
beauty. The pines were pale green in the sunshine, the
soil strangely red. There was a curious dryness, a hard
brilliance about it all.</p>

<p>As Hugh looked from the train window he had a feeling
of home-coming. It was as if his ancestors had lived in
this land; as if in no other could he thrive so well.</p>

<p>“I’m feeling heaps better,” he thought. “Only let me
get six months in these jolly old pine forests, living like a
wood-cutter. The life of nature, that’s what I need to
make a new man of me. Ah! this is my country. I’m
here now; and here I’ll stay.”</p>

<p>Looking at that sky so invincibly blue, that soil so subjugated
by the sun, it seemed hard to believe that elsewhere
there could be fog and cold and sleet. Here the
sunshine was of so conquering a quality, it was difficult
to think of sullen lands that could resist it.</p>

<p>Again Hugh felt that sense of familiarity: “I’m a son
of the sun,” he exulted; “a child of the sun-land.”</p>

<p>So absorbed was he that a rasping voice at his side
almost startled him.</p>

<p>“The verdure here is profligate, ain’t it?”</p>

<p>The speaker was a rusty, creaky man smoking a rank
cigar. He had a bony nose, and a ragged moustache.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
He wore a dusty bowler hat and a coat with a collar of
hard-bitten musk-rat.</p>

<p>“The pines do seem to thrive,” said Hugh.</p>

<p>“Pines is very tendatious,” observed the shabby man.
“Very saloobrious too.”</p>

<p>“Indeed,” said Hugh. “Are you a health-seeker?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. Not ’ealth,—wealth. I’m a man with a system,
I am. The finest system on the Riviera.”</p>

<p>“I wish mine was. It’s rather dicky.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I wasn’t referrin’ to my corporationus system.
It’s my system at roulette. Allow me....”</p>

<p>He handed Hugh a rather soiled card on which was
engraved:</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="bbox">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Professor Robert Bender,<br />
roulette expert,<br />
inventor of bender’s voisin system</span><br />
<i>Author of “How to live at the Cost of the Casino.”</i></p>
</div></div></div>

<p>“Yes,” supplemented the shabby man importantly.
“You see before you one of the greatest livin’ authorities
on roulette. I’ve studied it now for twenty years. They
all consult old Bob. Many a gentleman I’ve ’elped to
fortune. ’Avin’ no capital myself, I’m obliged to let
others ’ave the benefit of my experience.”</p>

<p>“And your system?” queried Hugh politely.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, it’s based on the fact that the old croupiers
’ave a ’abit of throwin’ the ball in a hotomatic way, so that
they ’ave spells when they throw into the same section of
the wheel. Of course, it calls for judgment and observation.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>“Luck, too, I should imagine.”</p>

<p>“Not so much. Luck is a thing we scientific roulette
players try not to recognize. We aim to beat chance by
calculation.”</p>

<p>“Is it really true,” said Hugh, “that one can live at the
cost of the Casino?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. Thousands are doin’ it this very day.
Why, I can go in any time and make a couple of louis.”</p>

<p>“I wish I could.”</p>

<p>“So you can, sir, with a little experience. You’re goin’
to Monte?”</p>

<p>“No, Menton.”</p>

<p>“Ah, that’s a pity. Mentony’s too full of English, too
deadly dull. Monte’s a sporty little gem, the most beautiful
spot on earth—and the wickedest.”</p>

<p>“That sounds interesting.”</p>

<p>“Interestin’ ... I should say so. There’s no square
mile on God’s globe so packed with drama. There’s no
theatre a patch on that Casino. You’d better get off at
Monte, sir, and let me put you on to my system. Sixteen
hundred francs capital is all you need, and I guarantees
you a daily profit of from twenty to eighty per cent.”</p>

<p>Hugh thought of the poor two thousand francs that
was to last him for six months.</p>

<p>“I’ll think over it. Meantime I’ve arranged to go to
Menton.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll surely see you at the tables before long.
By the way, sir, you see that gentleman with the white
spats? He’s a English gentleman, a Mister Jarvie Tope.
Very nice man, but he’s got a system that’s no good.
Don’t let him fool you with it.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Hugh, “I’ll be careful.”</p>

<p>The pine-lands had given way to vinelands, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
peaks to plains. The vines pushed jagged forks through
the red soil; the olive groves wimpled in the wind. The
goats and donkeys scarcely raised their heads to gaze at
the insolent train. Hugh was in such a deep reverie that
he did not notice the approach of Mr. Jarvie Tope.</p>

<p>Mr. Tope was a little rosy man, round and bland with
waxed grey moustaches. He was well groomed, and
seemed on the most excellent terms with life.</p>

<p>“Ha, ha!” he squeaked as he drew near to Hugh, “Old
Bob Bender’s been warning you against me, I could see it
in his eye, the rascal. Told you, no doubt, I’d try to put
you on to my system. Couldn’t, if I would. I’ve come
over to play for a syndicate.”</p>

<p>“Indeed. What sort of a system is yours?”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s based on the idea that the same phenomenon
cannot occur on the same spot at the same moment to-day
that it occurred at the same spot on the same day last
year. I have my phenomena carefully recorded and when
the times comes I bet on them. The probabilities are
millions in my favour.”</p>

<p>“There seems to be a lot of systems.”</p>

<p>“No end of ’em. We all think ours is the best and the
other fellows’ no good. With a bit of luck all are good,
but you need a lot of capital to defend yourself, and
you must be content with a very moderate return. And
after all none are infallible. That’s what we’re all seeking,
a formula that’s infallible. So far no one has found it,
but still we seek and hope.... You see that old fellow
at the end of the corridor?”</p>

<p>“The venerable old chap with the white beard?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I call him Walt Whitman. Well, he’s a man
over seventy, going to Monte Carlo for the first time, a
professor from the Sorbonne, Durand by name. They say<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
he has worked on his system for twenty years, and is
bringing the savings of a lifetime to test it. Ah! we’ll
see what we shall see. Fine looking old chap, isn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Very striking,—like a Hebrew prophet.”</p>

<p>“He has books and books of figures and calculations.
What his system is no one knows. I’ve seen a heap of
them come like conquerors and go away broken on the
wheel.”</p>

<p>“You know the place well?”</p>

<p>“I should think so. Never missed a season for twenty
years. Coming here has got to be a habit with me. In
summer I have a cottage in Kent where I grow roses; in
winter an apartment in Monte where I play roulette. Oh,
I’m a great boy, you don’t know me.”</p>

<p>Mr. Tope laughed in jolly appreciation of himself.</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose I’m crazy like the rest of ’em. We’re
all crazy there. The Casino is a great lunatic asylum.
We wander about as if we were free, but we’re not. Inevitably
our feet carry us back. Don’t let it get you,
young man. Avoid Monte as you would the plague....
By the way there’s the first call for lunch. I’m going to
have a wash first. See you later.”</p>


<h4>2.</h4>

<p>Hugh followed a line of passengers to the dining car.
He had found a place and was looking at the menu card
when the waiter ushered a lady into the opposite seat.
He looked up and then as quickly away. For even in that
casual glimpse he was aware that his vis-à-vis was most
alarmingly attractive.</p>

<p>Now Hugh was an unusually shy young man, and in the
ordinary course of events would have eaten his meal in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
silence, and gone away without a word. To his amazement,
he heard a firm, clear voice addressing him:</p>

<p>“Don’t you remember me?”</p>

<p>Suddenly he found himself gazing into a pair of smiling
brown eyes; but even as he looked the smile died in their
amber depths. In its place was embarrassment; a frown
puckered the delicately pencilled eyebrows. Again the
clear voice spoke almost with reproach.</p>

<p>“Oh, I beg your pardon, but you are ridiculously like a
friend of mine,—Paul Vulning.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, that’s curious.”</p>

<p>“Yes, too absurd. For now I look, you’re quite a bit
different. Paul must be five years older than you, but he
looks ten. The dear boy doesn’t take the care of himself
he ought. A sad scapegrace.”</p>

<p>She regarded him again, then laughed joyously.</p>

<p>“Why, here we are, two perfect strangers talking together
like old pals. What must you think of me? Because
of your likeness to Paul I feel as if I’d known you
for ages. What’s your name?”</p>

<p>“Hugh Kildair.”</p>

<p>“Sounds deliciously Scotch. But you’re English, aren’t
you?”</p>

<p>“I’ve lived all my life in England.”</p>

<p>“Indeed? So have I. But never again. The English
are so cold. They don’t understand temperament. Even
before my husband died and we lost all our money, I was
quite fed up with it. Now I spend the winter in Monte
and the summer in Aix.”</p>

<p>The waiter interrupted her with the wine card. She
looked rather disdainfully down the list and chose the
most expensive. Then she scanned Hugh appraisingly.
His new grey suit sat well. His collar and tie were of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
the right sort. He looked clean, correct; a public school
man. The lady seemed satisfied.</p>

<p>“You’re a nice boy,” she said happily. “I’m Mrs. Belmire.
Every one in Monte knows me. You’re going to
Monte, of course?”</p>

<p>Hugh hesitated. “No, I’m rather seedy. I’m going to
Menton to rest up.”</p>

<p>“Menton. Why! you’ll be bored to death there! Nothing
but old tabbies who go to each others’ teas and talk
gossip. Oh, you’ll hate it. Get off at Monte. Promise
me you will.”</p>

<p>She was really a beautiful woman. Everything about
her was so exquisitely correct. Her complexion had the
delicacy of porcelain; her henna-coloured hair looked as if
it had just come from the hands of the coiffeur; her eyes
had passion in their tarn-brown depths. As her hand
touched his he felt that he would have got off at Hades
to please her.</p>

<p>“Seems a good idea; I might as well rest there.”</p>

<p>“Topping! it’s decided then. You’ll come and see me.
I suppose you’ll stay at the ‘Paris.’ I wouldn’t though.
They’ll charge you two hundred francs a night for a
room. Oh, yes, my dear boy, you’re going to say their
charges are their charges, but you don’t know Monte.
Unless you’re odiously oofy, don’t go to the Paris. It’s
simply infested with ‘rastas’ and <i>nouveaux riches</i>. Some of
the hotels on the hill are really quite nice, and you’ll meet
the right sort of people there. You see, I’m taking a motherly
interest in you. I don’t want to see you foolishly extravagant.
Above all, don’t throw your money away recklessly
at the Casino. If you must play let me be your adviser.
Let me give you the benefit of my experience.”</p>

<p>“That’s awfully nice of you.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>“Not at all. I’ve helped heaps of men. I can’t afford
to play myself, but I enjoy seeing others win. Have a
cigarette?”</p>

<p>He took one from a gold case, and they puffed between
courses. She sipped only a little of the wine, and the bottle
was half full when the waiter whisked it away. She
ordered a <i>fine champagne</i> with her coffee, and graciously
allowed Hugh to pay the bill. As she rose to leave she
gave his hand a little squeeze.</p>

<p>“There! I’ve enjoyed my lunch so much! Remember
me; Mrs. Belmire. And don’t forget to get off at Monte.”</p>

<p>The paying of the bill had a sobering effect on him.</p>

<p>“After all,” he thought, “if she knew I was a nobody
with only two thousand francs in the world she wouldn’t
wipe her shoes on me. As for meeting her in Monte, this
decides me. I’ll steer clear of the place.”</p>


<h4>3.</h4>

<p>The scenery was as lovely as a painted panel. Between
umbrella pines he saw the majestic sway of the sea.
Snowy villas peeped from sombre cyprus groves. The
palms were pale gold in the wistful sunshine. Magic
names glorified the commonplace looking stations.—San
Raphael, Agay, Nice. In the setting sun the way seemed
to be growing more and more wonderful, as if working up
to a climax of beauty. Every moment moved him to fresh
rapture. And to think that this loveliness had been here
all the time and he had not known! How could people
continue to exist in that grim grey London? Was there
such a place as this, or was he dreaming it? Would he
ever go back again to fog and grime? No, never,
never....</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>Villefranche, Beaulieu, Eze ... the light had faded,
yet still he stared at the shadows through the darkened
pane. He was aware suddenly that the glass was reflecting
mirror-like the compartment behind him. At first he
thought it was empty, then he heard a sigh and saw it
was occupied by a slim slip of a girl. She was sitting in
the corner, very quiet, very anxious. She was dressed in
deep black, and her white, rather haggard face had a
kind of pathetic appeal. He noted all this without any
particular interest. Then suddenly she took off her hat
and he saw that she had the most wonderful hair in the
world.</p>

<p>She rose to arrange it before the small mirror above
her seat. With a brusque movement she withdrew two
combs and let it ripple down in a rain of gold. It
reached below her waist. It covered her like a cape, it
shimmered in the lamp-light, it seemed as luminous as a
flame. At the sight of such glory Hugh turned and stared.</p>

<p>Then the girl noticed him and flushed with shame. She
clutched her bright tresses to her head and swiftly rearranged
them. She turned her back....</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p><i>Monte Carlo.</i></p>

<p>They were getting in now. The train seemed to plunge
into a dazzle of light; then the darkness of another tunnel;
then a long green station. On the lamps so meanly
printed, he could see the magic name that opens wide the
portals of romance. Surely it should be blazoned in fiery
capitals on the heights of heaven! This then was the
spot of which people talk and dream, that masterpiece
of nature and art which never disenchants, which is adorable
even in its cruelty. Fatal, fascinating name,—Monte
Carlo.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>It was the climax of the beautiful journey. The train
disgorged nearly all its passengers as if this place like
a magnet was drawing them out. He saw Bob Bender,
and Jarvie Tope. He watched old Professor Durand
looking curiously about him, and a white-haired porter
taking the baggage of Mrs. Belmire. He felt alone,
abandoned.</p>

<p>As the train lingered, loth to leave this charmed spot,
Hugh felt a sudden desire to get off. He saw the fair-haired
girl struggling with a basket-valise. With a sudden
impulse he gathered together his own luggage and
prepared to descend, but the train was already in motion.</p>

<p>“Just as well. Now for Menton.”</p>

<p>Then behold! the train halted again and backed to the
station.</p>

<p>“Fate!” said Hugh and jumped off. He passed through
a long baggage room into a courtyard where there was
a line of luxurious hotel omnibuses and porters in livery.
The court was backed by a wall of rock that rose to the
heights of a glorious garden. Palms speared the silvery
arc-lights. Masses of geraniums stained the face of the
rock. On the winding steps that led to the garden a
nude statue of a woman was set in a niche amid ferns and
water-lilies, and a diamond spray of water.</p>

<p>On the long hill to the right was a line of fiacres. He
saw the fair-haired girl hand her bag to one of the drivers.</p>

<p>“Pension Paoli,” she said.</p>

<p>Hugh watched her drive away; then he, too, hailed a
fiacre. The dark driver bent to him with smiling politeness.</p>

<p>“Where to, monsieur?”</p>

<p>Hugh thought for a moment. As he stood there he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
had a strange thrill of wonder and of joy. He seemed to
breathe an enchanted air; the silver lights amid the trees
were those of fairyland; he felt as if he were hesitating
on the very threshold of romance.</p>

<p>“Pension Paoli,” he answered.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER THREE<br />


THE POISONED PARADISE</h3>
</div>

<h4>1.</h4>

<p class="drop-cap2">AN amiable, early morning sun was irradiating that
great theatre which is Monte Carlo, and a regiment
of stage hands were preparing the scene for
another day. Hawk-eyed bands of them with brush and
pan were grooming the cleanest streets in the world,
pouncing triumphantly on burnt matches and unsightly
cigarette ends. Other bands invaded the beautiful gardens,
trimming each blade of grass to the same size and
meticulously barbering each bud and flower. They
moved with nonchalant grace, these brown-skinned Monegascans,
as became the servitors of that great, benevolent
institution, the Casino.</p>

<p>As Hugh passed through the gardens, breathing the
perfumed air, a great delight glowed in him. His first
impression was of the theatric quality of the place, its
note of unreality. It was a fit setting for the pleasure-seeking
hordes, for the legions of luxury, for these dreaming
of fortune and those dead to hope. He never lost
his sense of its unreality, of its being a stage scene, on
which was played a daily drama in three acts: Morning,
Afternoon, and Evening.</p>

<p>Passing between the Casino and the Hotel de Paris, he
descended in the direction of the Condamine. At the top
of a long hill, a little way past the post office, he paused
with a joy that thrilled him to ecstasy....</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span><i>He saw a little U shaped harbour shielded from the
sea. It was as delicate as a pastel, a placque of sapphire
set in pearl. In the crystal air the red-roofed houses
crowded close to it. The terraced town rose on tip-toe
to peer at it. It was all glitter and gleam, and radiant
beauty. And yonder in sombre contrast rose the Rock,
monstrous, mediæval,—so scornful of that hectic modernity
across the bay.</i>...</p>

<p>He climbed the long steep hill, crossed the sunny square
in front of the palace and plunged into the cool gloom of
the narrow streets. Wandering idly along he came
to a low brown house with a tiny porch, and four
pepper-trees in front. He looked at it carelessly enough,
then turned and wandered into the garden of the Prince.
He gazed curiously at a broken pillar covered with ivy.
There was a spring sunk deep in the rock; the flowers
bloomed there; and bees and butterflies made the nook gay
and tuneful. He found a bench that overlooked the glimmering
sea and rested awhile.</p>

<p>As he sat pensively dreaming, two pale ghosts may have
been watching him; a man strong and tall, a girl sweet
and fragrant as a flower. Perhaps wrapt in that great
love to which he owed his being, they were drawing near
to him with wistful pain, with adoring tenderness. Who
knows?...</p>

<p>Filled with a strange melancholy Hugh rose and went
his unheeding way. Again he looked carelessly at the
house in which his mother was born, in which <i>her</i> mother
still lived....</p>

<p>But he remembered nothing. He did not know. He
never knew....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span></p>


<h4>2.</h4>

<p>The chief recommendation of the Pension Paoli was its
cheapness. For twenty francs a day Hugh had his board
and a chamber that overlooked the red roofs and the
blue sea beyond. He had a tiny balcony, too, and in the
lazy, limpid days he cultivated a cheerful lethargy.</p>

<p>It was one of those Bohemian establishments peculiar
to the Principality. People came and went without exciting
interest. The <i>clientele</i> was imperturbably cosmopolitan,
the cuisine piquantly Italian. At the table d’hôte
one heard half a dozen tongues and no one was concerned
about the respectability of his neighbour. Every one
seemed to gamble, and to think of little but the Casino.</p>

<p>Hugh’s first evening was typical. He was trying to go
to sleep, when about midnight some one entered the next
room. He heard the sound of money being emptied on the
table, counted, then a sigh of satisfaction. Every night
this happened, only some nights there was no money and
curses took the place of content. On such nights he
would say to himself, “The Twitcher’s been loosing.”</p>

<p>The Twitcher was a tall weedy man, who, owing to some
nervous malady, had a trick of raising and lowering his
eyebrows. He had a friend whom Hugh called the Sword-Swallower,
on account of his way of eating ravioli. The
S. S. was small and brisk, with tiny, cropped head, and a
large but carefully groomed moustache. His trousers
were striped and of the same width all the way down.</p>

<p>The S. S. and the Twitcher were allies and united in a
dislike for a third man, whom Hugh dubbed the Rat. This
was a sturdy, bandy-legged fellow with a bulging jaw, a
broken nose and close-set, beady eyes. His skin had a
curious pallor, a prison pallor, Hugh thought. He decided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
that the Rat had just finished doing time and was
now spending the swag.</p>

<p>One day he overheard a conversation between the
Twitcher and the Sword-Swallower which referred to the
Rat.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the Twitcher, “the fellow’s as crooked as a
ram’s horn. I saw him do it again.”</p>

<p>“Do what?”</p>

<p>“He puts a louis on one of the dozens then watches the
ball. Just as it drops he shifts his stake to the winning
dozen. He is quick as a flash and nine times out of ten
the croupier doesn’t notice it. So he gets paid.”</p>

<p>“He’s a shady one. If you leave your money in the
table at night, be sure to lock your door.”</p>

<p>“I’ve never done so yet, but in future I’ll be more careful.”</p>

<p>At this moment the Rat entered and greeted them with
a twinkle in his beady eyes.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said briskly, “I’ve just made my ‘day,’—five
louis. Now I can rest.”</p>

<p>“You’re easily satisfied,” said the Twitcher; “if I
don’t clear twenty, I think I’m out of luck.”</p>

<p>“Not me,” said the Sword-Swallower. “If I can make
the bank cough up a couple of louis I quit. But I never
fail.”</p>

<p>“What’s your system?” demanded the Rat.</p>

<p>“Oh, I play for a <i>paroli</i>. And yours?”</p>

<p>“I always play between the dozens,” answered the Rat;
“it’s the safest.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the Twitcher. “You play a safe game all
right. As for me, give me the <i>traversals</i>....”</p>

<p>Here the conversation became too technical for Hugh
to follow. Presently the Twitcher said to the S. S.:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>“Come on. Let’s go and scratch.”</p>

<p>As they went away, the Rat installed himself in a comfortable
chair and called for a <i>Dubonnet</i>. Then he
lit a cigarette from a yellow packet, blew the smoke
blissfully through his nostrils, sipped his apéritif, and
seemed content with all the world.</p>

<p>“A sinister chap,” Hugh thought, and ceased to look
at him. Suddenly he heard a gasp of dismay.</p>

<p>The Rat was staring out of the window, his sallow face
livid, his hands clutching the table edge. Then he dived
through the little door at the back of the restaurant and
disappeared. Astonished, Hugh followed the direction of
the man’s gaze. All he saw was a mild old priest peering
rather curiously at the house. Hugh watched wonderingly;
but the priest, after lingering a little, went slowly
away, and the Rat did not finish his apéritif.</p>

<p>Among the other boarders were two Swedish women,
mother and daughter. The mother was short and fat,
and the daughter, tall and thin; but both were blonde
and had shiny, red faces. They dressed in black satin,
with gold chains round their necks and diamond rings on
every available finger. They ate gluttonously, and spoke
a harsh, gabbling tongue. Although they were evidently
rich, they gambled greedily for five franc pieces.</p>

<p>Occasionally Hugh saw the girl with the bright, heaping
hair. Sometimes at meals he would see her slip into a remote
corner, quiet as a mouse. She looked at no one, kept
her head down, ate very little and stole out again as softly
as she had come.</p>

<p>One day he questioned Terese, the waitress, about her.</p>

<p>“Ah,” said Terese, “you’re asking me something. All
I can tell you is that her name on the register is Margot
Leblanc. She’s a queer one. Never speaks to a soul.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
She spends her time between the church and the Casino,
between praying and gambling. I can’t make her out.”</p>

<p>Hugh’s curiosity was aroused. But the girl’s manner
discouraged any attempt at acquaintance. Once when he
chanced to encounter her on the stair, his polite greeting
was met by such a sullen silence that his interest in her
faded.</p>


<h4>3.</h4>

<p>His health was improving daily. It seemed quite wonderful.
Instead of watching the tennis-players, he wanted
to join them. The distance of his walks lengthened. He
joined the little English library and changed his books
frequently. On the heights above the town, sitting under
an olive tree with the vast shimmer of the sea below him,
he read through long sunny hours. Sometimes he got out
his box of water colours, and made some sketches.</p>

<p>At half past nine every morning he sauntered down the
palm-lined avenue that descends to the Casino. Even at
that hour it was packed with luxurious motors, and
he christened it “Limousine Lane.” Dozens of gardeners
were valeting the lawns on either hand to an unheard of
greenness and trimness. The air was always delicious.</p>

<p>At the foot of “Limousine Lane” was the “Cheese,” a
round grassy mound diagrammed with flowers. It was
shaded by four proud palms and a great rubber tree.
Around it were seats for spectators. Lounging there
Hugh saw the world of fashion parade. Women exquisitely
dressed, and men immaculate sauntered past like
actors on a stage. They mounted the seven carpeted
steps of the Casino, paused for a moment as if conscious
that every detail of their costumes was perfect; then
turned and were swallowed by the Temple of Chance.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>While Hugh never wearied of this constant swirl of
elegance, his main interest was in the swinging doors of
the Casino itself. He never tired of watching the players
come and go. One day Bob Bender came down the steps
looking rustier and more mildewed than ever. He recognized
Hugh.</p>

<p>“What, sir,—not playing yet?”</p>

<p>“No, I have no money to lose. Are you doing all
right?”</p>

<p>The old gambler shook his head in a melancholy way.</p>

<p>“Not exactly. I’m transversing a bad time. I was
expecting a gentleman from America who wanted me to
play for him, but he is delayed,—a Mr. Fetterstein.
Maybe you’ve heard of him?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Well, his not comin’ has deranged me. I’ve been playin’
a little game of my own but I ’aven’t got capital
enough. This mornin’ I came up against zero three times.
A man can’t do anything against that. Now I’m off to
get a bite of lunch. Maybe things will come my way this
afternoon.”</p>

<p>He shambled off. Before going to his own luncheon
Hugh strolled around the gardens. Nurses were watching
beautiful, well-behaved children. The round pond mirrored
the palms and pink geraniums; the little stream was
fringed by ferns and flowers and starred with water-lilies.
The green sweep of the sward was like a carpet, set with
strange exotic trees, agave and cactus and dwarf oranges.
Midway there was a little artificial ford, with gold-fishes
glancing in the lazy ripples.</p>

<p>Yet there were jarring notes in this harmony. An old
man for instance who sat on a bench reading discarded
journals. He wore eye-glasses and had an air of dignity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
quite at variance with his rags. His boots were altogether
disreputable and his coat would have disgraced a decent
ash-bin. Yet it was easy to see that he had been a person
of education and refinement who had lost a fortune at the
tables. Hugh took a seat beside him.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the old fellow, “what do you think of it?”</p>

<p>“It’s beautiful,” said Hugh with fervour.</p>

<p>The other looked at him sarcastically.</p>

<p>“Beautiful, yes ... and it’s to me and the likes of
me you owe it; we pay for it; we keep it up. Take a good
gaze at me, young chap, and you’ll enjoy it all the more.”
He laughed so disagreeably that Hugh rose and left him.
But the gardens did not seem as lovely as before.</p>


<h4>4.</h4>

<p>Hugh’s favourite walk was along the highroad that
led to the Tête du Chien. It crossed a dizzy bridge over
a deep gorge in which the washerwomen hung their linen
to dry. At the mouth of this gorge, framed in the arches
of the railway bridge, was a tiny chapel, and behind it, like
a slab of lapis lazuli, the harbour. Climbing still higher
the road passed the Persian villa and reached the top of
the hill. Almost directly below were the red roofs of the
Condamine.</p>

<p>Continuing still further the road swung into a great
curve high above Monaco, disclosing both the Rock and
the sweet serenity of the sea. Terrace upon terrace of
olive trees rose to the base of the mountain.</p>

<p>Hugh was walking along this road one morning, admiring
the beauty that surrounded him, when suddenly he
glanced down. In the dust at his feet, fresh and glistening,
was a crimson patch. “Curious,” he thought; “those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
marks look as if a heavy body had fallen here.” He examined
the stone-wall and found a slight spatter of blood.
A little further on, he picked up something that made
him look very thoughtful, a bit of bony fibre, to which
adhered a few dark hairs. Strange! He looked downwards,
and saw that he stood just above the Cemetery
of Monaco. He found the path and slowly descended.</p>

<p>He searched for some time for the suicide’s section of
the cemetery which he had been told was cunningly concealed.
A great high wall separated the lower from the
upper graveyard, and built half the way up the face
of it, was another wall, the space between the two forming
a narrow shelf. There was no access to this shelf except
through a broken place in the balustrade of the stairway
just large enough to pass a coffin. As he looked down
from the upper wall, Hugh saw that the whole length of
the shelf was closely packed with nameless graves. In
one place where the earth had been thrown carelessly up a
rusty shovel leaned against the wall. The air had the
smell of a charnel pit.</p>

<p>He climbed the hill again. The place where he had
seen the blood was now quite clean. There was no
trace of any disturbance. Some one had come in his absence
and tidied things up. The sky had suddenly grown
grey, grey too and sinister the mountains. He had an uneasy
sense that somewhere in the olive trees unseen eyes
were watching him; that he was being spied on and
shadowed.</p>


<h4>5.</h4>

<p>Another day when he took this solitary walk, twilight
was gathering and the roofs of the Condamine were softened
to a coral mist. The space between the rock of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
Monaco and the Tête du Chien was filled with sunset after-glow
as a cup is filled with wine. The olive trees lately
twinkling in the sunshine were now mysteriously still.</p>

<p>When Hugh came to the highest point overlooking the
town, he stopped to rest. The rock of Monaco rose
like a monster from the sea, and was as dim and silent
as a tomb. He could distinguish the courtyard of the
Palace, greyly alight, and a black stencilling of windows.
A solitary lamp revealed a turret and an ancient archway,
all else was gloom. In its austere mediæval strength the
rock seemed the abode of mystery and silence.</p>

<p>And Monte Carlo! Looking towards it Hugh could
see nothing but light. The mountains were pricked with
patterns of light, the great hotels were packed with light.
And all seemed to concentrate in one dazzling centre, the
source from which this luxury of light flowed,—the Casino.</p>

<p>Then he noticed that on a bench near him was a stooping
figure. To his surprise he recognized it as that of
Professor Durand. The old man was clutching in his
hands a number of the Revue of Monte Carlo with its
columns of permanencies.</p>

<p>“What a pity!” thought Hugh. “So fine, so venerable
a head bent over those wretched figures. This man who
might be taken for a preacher, a prophet,—a slave to
this vulgar vice, puzzling over systems, trying to outwit
the Goddess Chance. <i>Le calcul peut vaincre le jeu</i> ...
that is the lying phrase that lures them. Fools!”</p>

<p>Then he turned for the Professor was addressing him.
Hugh saw a flashing eye, a noble brow.</p>

<p>“Young man, you will excuse me, but I claim the privilege
of age. At the Sorbonne I have lectured to thousands
like you. I speak because I noted in your passing
glance something of disdain.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>Hugh made a gesture of protest.</p>

<p>“No, I do not blame you. You see me with these numbers.
But you misjudge me.... Listen....”</p>

<p>The old man seemed to grow taller. He stretched his
hand to where the Casino glittered like a crown of gems.</p>

<p>“I am eighty years old to-day. I have a feeling that
I shall never see another birthday. But there is one thing
I hope to do before I die ... <i>to ruin that accursed
place</i>.”</p>

<p>Hugh stared at him.</p>

<p>“I speak for the good of humanity, I speak because of
the evil it has done in the past, the harm it can do in years
to come. I speak in behalf of its thousand of blasted
homes, its broken hearts, its shameful graves. Ah! you
only see the beautiful surface. You do not see below. But
I do. And to my eyes yonder rock on which it stands, is
built of human skulls, the waves that lap it are tears and
blood. Look at the loveliness of earth and sky, the purple
mountain rising from the silver sea, the dreamlike peace,
the soft and gentle air. No painted picture was ever half
so beautiful. How happy all might be here! A paradise,
a human paradise; but because of that place, a poisoned
paradise.”</p>

<p>Hugh stared harder. The old man’s voice was tense
with passion.</p>

<p>“You think I am a fanatic, a madman. Wait and see.
I am going to destroy that place. For years I have
worked on my great plan. It is the crown of my life. In a
few weeks I will begin to play. I shall win and win. By
mathematics I will frustrate chance. I will compel them
to close their doors, for my system is invincible. God
has given me this task to do, and I will complete it before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
I die. Into my hands He has delivered them. I am His
instrument of vengeance. Let them beware!”</p>

<p>In a magnificent gesture he shook his clenched fists
at the Casino. When Hugh left him he was still standing
like a prophet on the heights, staring down on his poisoned
paradise.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER FOUR<br />


THE GIRL WHO WAS ALWAYS ALONE</h3>
</div>

<h4>1.</h4>

<p class="drop-cap">CHRISTMAS had come and gone, a strange, unreal
Christmas, with none of those rigors and austerities
that Hugh had been accustomed to associate
with the season. The long stretch of garden in front of
the Casino was enamelled with patterns of pink, purple
and milky cyclamen, as brilliant as banners against the
green; the ribbon-like paths were terra-cotta; and the
usual indolent gardeners were shaving and shampooing
the velvety lawns.</p>

<p>Hugh was feeling elaborately well. In the last two
months a great change had come over him. His pale face
had taken on a healthy tan; its hollows had disappeared.
A new force, a new courage possessed him; he looked a
lithe, swift youth, as clean as fire.</p>

<p>It was then with a joyous sense of recovered manhood
that he took the early train one morning for La Turbie,
and started to walk to Menton. As he swung along the
High Corniche it seemed as if he was looking over the
nose of an aeroplane. The brilliant panorama of shore
and sea expanded before his gaze. He saw the Rock rising
like a huge hump from the water, the crowded red roofs
of the Principality, the dainty hoop of the harbour. His
gaze shifted to the dazzling curve of the coast, the pretentious
Casino, Cap Martin with its gleam of modern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
villas in ancient olive groves. A desire to paint this
beauty kindled and glowed within him.</p>

<p>He climbed to the ruins of the old castle of Roquebrune
and gazed through a round window onto a dizzy
gulf of sea and sky. His reverie was disturbed by
a sound of voices and as he descended to the courtyard
he saw a woman standing by the battlements, looking out
into the great, shining space. She was tall and graceful,
dressed in a jersey costume of primrose silk. It was Mrs.
Belmire.</p>

<p>As if she had known he was there, she stretched her
hand backwards, without turning her head.</p>

<p>“Come here,” she commanded.</p>

<p>Hugh obeyed. He took the outstretched hand and was
drawn gently to her side.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it lovely,” she sighed.</p>

<p>He felt her hand tighten in his. He had a sudden
desire to kiss her lovely neck. Slowly she turned towards
him, then stepped back and stamped her foot in vexation.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s <i>you</i>!” she cried. “Well, of all the— I
thought it was Mr. Fetterstein.”</p>

<p>But quickly she recovered herself.</p>

<p>“I’ve a bone to pick with you, naughty young man.
Why have you never come to see me?”</p>

<p>Hugh had no excuse ready.</p>

<p>“I had made up my mind not to speak to you again.
But there! Good nature was always my weakness. Promise
me to come soon and I’ll forgive you.”</p>

<p>While Hugh was promising another man joined them.
Mrs. Belmire turned to the newcomer radiantly.</p>

<p>“Mr. Fetterstein; I want to introduce Mr. Kildair; a
young countryman of mine.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>Mr. Fetterstein did not look enthusiastic, but mustered
a show of cordiality.</p>

<p>“Pleased to meet you,” he said; and offered a large
hard hand. In fact everything about Mr. Fetterstein
suggested hardness. He looked muscular and forceful.
His hair was iron grey; the lines of his clean-shaven face
were firm and grim; his jaw strong; his eyes shrewd; his
voice had a determined rasp. Even his clothes were made
of some hard, wear-resisting tweed.</p>

<p>“Now, come,” said Mrs. Belmire; “I positively insist on
your admiring this view.”</p>

<p>“If you insist, Mrs. Belmire, there is nothing more to
be said. But you know how looking at scenery always
makes me hungry. Even now I’ve got an appetite I
wouldn’t sell for a twenty dollar bill. I grant you this is
fine all right. We haven’t got anything in the United
States that could touch it. But for my part I’d rather
look into the inside of a good car than at the finest bit
of scenery the Lord ever made.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you horrid materialist! But you must excuse
him, Mr. Kildair. His enthusiasm is entirely professional.
Mr. Fetterstein makes automobiles in America somewhere....”</p>

<p>“Detroit, Michigan, ma’am. We have five factories
running right now. In fact I’m over here to pick up
pointers from French cars. I’ve got one down there that’s
a hummer. But that reminds me, Mrs. Belmire, we’d
better be getting <i>ong root</i> if we want to make <i>Song Reemo</i>
in time for <i>dayjoonay</i>. Come on. Let’s get down if
you’ve had enough of your old ruin.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Belmire sighed. “I’m sorry you don’t appreciate
my ruin.”</p>

<p>“I guess it’s a first class ruin all right, but they ain’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
much in my line. Now, Mrs. Belmire, if you’ll kindly give
me a few pointers on roulette when we get back to Monte
Carlo to-night, that’d make a hit with me.”</p>

<p>They descended to the village square where stood a
long vicious-looking, torpedo-shaped car. It was painted
a warm orange, with finishings of nickel. In the curving
body was a well with two seats, and the whole thing looked
like an aeroplane without wings.</p>

<p>“Twelve cylinders,” said Mr. Fetterstein, as he climbed
into the raking seat. Mrs. Belmire looked distinctly nervous
but bravely adjusted her cloak and veil. Mr. Fetterstein
raced the engine, jammed in his first speed; the
car leapt forward like a flame. Hugh saw it flashing
down the white road and thrilled as it took the sharp
curves. Then a shoulder of mountain hid it from his
view.</p>

<p>“A most delightful woman,” he thought; “no wonder
she has a lot of admirers. I wish I could call on her, but
what’s the good. She’d only find out that I’m what Mr.
Fetterstein would describe as a ‘four-flusher.’”</p>


<h4>2.</h4>

<p>Hugh lunched and lounged in Menton, until he felt a
strange nostalgia for Monte Carlo come over him.</p>

<p>“Curious,” he reflected; “already the place has such a
hold on me, I cannot leave it even for a few hours.”</p>

<p>He jumped into a big lemon-coloured motor bus and in
half an hour was sitting in the Café de Paris.</p>

<p>“Hullo, old chap,” he heard a shrill voice say, and
looked up to see Mr. Jarvie Tope. Mr. Tope seemed as
if he had stepped from a band-box, a flawless figure of a
well-dressed man.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>“Hullo!” responded Hugh. “You’re looking well.”</p>

<p>Mr. Tope raised his jaunty panama.</p>

<p>“I should think so, sixty and still going strong. Getting
younger instead of older. Oh, I’m a great boy, I am.”</p>

<p>“Come and have tea with me,” Hugh begged.</p>

<p>Mr. Tope sat down. Together they gazed at the brilliant
scene. The air was bright with banners and exultant
with music. Gay crowds promenaded in front of the
Casino. An aeroplane swooped down, scaring the drowsy
pigeons on the cornice. Men watched it through their
monocles, women from under their tiny frilled sunshades.
Under the striped umbrellas elegant <i>demi-mondaines</i> sipped
their orangeades; professional dandies, slim and elegant,
passed amid the green tables; and dancing girls, befurred
and bejewelled, sauntered on their way to the <i>Thé
Dansant</i>. It was a kaleidoscope of colour; a moving
pattern of dainty costumes; an entertainment that never
lost its interest.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it just like a scene in a theatre?” said Mr. Tope.
“That’s how it strikes me even after twenty years. A
beautifully dressed crowd, beautifully behaved; yet below
it all vice unfathomable. It sometimes reminds me of the
rainbow iridescence one sees on a pool of scum....
By the way, I haven’t seen you tempting the fickle goddess?”</p>

<p>“No, I haven’t been inside the Casino.”</p>

<p>“Ha! that’s quite a distinction. I noticed you talking
to old Bob Bender the other day.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he’s having rather a hard time. He’s waiting a
backer from America.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you needn’t waste any sympathy on old Bob.
He’ll never starve.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>“Well,” said Mr. Tope, lowering his voice to a whisper,
“they say he’s in the service of the Secret Police.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Ah, young man! you only see the showy side of Monte;
but believe me, there’s a very seamy under one. This is
the most cosmopolitan spot in the world, and criminals of
all countries collect here. You might call it a sort of
criminal clearing-house. Well, to counteract this, the
Casino people have the most efficient police force in Europe.
They have agents in all the big capitals; an international
crook can’t put his foot in Monaco without being
recognized and watched.”</p>

<p>“You surprise me.”</p>

<p>“Do I? Let me tell you: the rooms are full of detectives,
male and female. The chief of the Secret Police is
a man of genius, a Swiss called Krantz. He speaks seven
languages and seems to have an eighth sense, the sense of
detection. You may have seen him, a tall, thin man
dressed in black with a dark, clean-shaven face. He always
wears a smile of cheerful simplicity.”</p>

<p>“And Bob?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Bob’s just a spy. He keeps track of the English
crooks and shadows if required. They say Krantz values
him.”</p>

<p>“It seems very strange to me.”</p>

<p>“Not at all. If you only knew the underground workings
of this place, the mentality, the way in which everything
is run.... Why, here you’re not living in the
Twentieth Century at all. It’s mediæval. Even now
some spy may be trying to over-hear us.”</p>

<p>“A queer place!”</p>

<p>“Yes, and packed with the queerest people on earth.
Now, for instance, that little girl in black, just entering.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>Hugh started. The girl was Margot Leblanc. He had
not seen her for some time, and had wondered if she was
still at the pension. She was dressed shabbily and as she
passed he saw that her face was white and haggard, and
her eyes stared vacantly before her. She sat down at a
nearby table.</p>

<p>“Now, that girl,” continued Mr. Tope, “is a puzzle to
me. She came here about two months ago and she has
never been seen to speak to any one. She is always alone.
Nobody knows anything about her. She spends most of
her time in the Rooms gambling with small stakes. I
have seen her stand silently at a table for hours.... By
the way, here come my friends, the Calderbrooks. Let me
introduce you.”</p>

<p>The Calderbrooks were so uncompromisingly English,
that their nationality was recognizable a long way off.
They wore tailored costumes made of the same kind of
tweed, with stockings of wool and low tan shoes. Under
broad-brimmed hats their faces were pink and cheerful.
The mother was sweet; the girl pretty; the father a tall
thin man, with drooping moustache, a mild manner, and
pale blue eyes.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mrs. Calderbrook, after they had been introduced,
“we’re going on to Mentony; but we thought
we must spend a day or two here.... Perfectly beautiful!
Mr. Tope tells me you don’t go to the Rooms? How
very extraordinary! Of course, we strongly disapprove
of the whole thing; but I think every one should go once,
if it’s only to see. We’re going in now for the first time.
Mr. Tope has promised to be our guide. We shall play
just once to say we have done so. You’d better come
with us.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>Hugh shook his head smilingly; “I’d rather not, thank
you. I’ll wait here till you come out.”</p>

<p>“All right. Shan’t be long.”</p>

<p>Piloted by Mr. Tope the three mounted the carpeted
steps, passed the bowing flunkeys, and disappeared
through the swinging glass doors. In half an hour they
reappeared. They were quite excited.</p>

<p>“It’s wonderful,” said Mrs. Calderbrook; “Alice put
five francs on the twenty-one, that being her age. What
do you think! The twenty-one came up. They paid her
a hundred and eighty francs. Of course we stopped at
once. It doesn’t do to abuse one’s luck. I really believe
we are lucky. We’re going again to-night. Father will
try this time,—won’t you, Father?”</p>

<p>Mr. Calderbrook said he would in his weak, refined
voice. Alice was shyly radiant. Hugh wished them further
good fortune and they returned to their hotel, eagerly
talking of the play.</p>


<h4>3.</h4>

<p>Hugh remained a while longer. He was watching the
girl of his pension. Her face was pinched and peaked, her
eyes strangely haunting in their pathos. She was so
thin that he could see the outline of her sharp shoulder
blades under her shabby jacket. Her bright hair was
braided and coiled away under a hat of black crepe.</p>

<p>“Poor little devil,” Hugh thought; “she looks up against
it.”</p>

<p>Presently she took a note-book with black glazed covers
from her bag, and began to turn its pages abstractedly.
Hugh saw that it was filled with columns of figures.</p>

<p>“Roulette records,” he thought again, “the same idiotic
obsession.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>Soon she rose; and having finished his tea, he sauntered
idly after her. He thought she was going to re-enter
the Casino; but instead she turned up-hill in the direction
of the town. He saw her climb the steps of the Church
and enter its swinging door.</p>

<p>After waiting a little, he, too, entered. He found her
seated in the cool dusk, her slim hands crossed and her
eyes closed. Whether she was sleeping or praying he
could not tell. He watched her for a while; then as she
continued to sit immovable he went away.</p>


<h4>4.</h4>

<p>Hugh had found that the strange theatrical charm of
Monte Carlo was most obvious after dark, and he never
tired of wandering through the still gardens, breathing the
delicious freshness of the air. Whichever way he looked a
picture formed itself. The tiny paths were like coral
ribbands on a gown of green, embroidered with pansy
patterns of crimson, violet and silver. Under the lamps
the blades of the patrician palms shone like swords. There
were lace-screens of translucent green, rich velvet dusks,
and sudden surprises of silver. The fountain sprayed
diamonds into the dark pool, from which came the ruddy
flash of gold-fishes; the roses climbed the palms as if to
reach the light.</p>

<p>That evening he took a seat on the terrace. He heard
below him the soft crooning of the sea, and felt its cool
breath. Behind him was starlight and softly luminous
mountains; in front, deep violet space ... mystery,
immensity.</p>

<p>A small form came slowly along the terrace. As it
drew near he saw it was the strange girl who was always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
alone. Once or twice she stopped, looking out over the
balustrade to the sea. As she passed him he saw that her
face had the vacant look of a sleep-walker. She sank on a
bench, and took a glazed note-book from her bag. As she
looked at it she sighed with weariness. Her head drooped
forward and she slept.</p>

<p>Another dark form drew near her, the furtive figure
of a man. Softly he sat down on the same bench and
seemed to edge nearer and nearer.</p>

<p>Hugh rose, making unnecessary noise. The man, with
a start, glanced his way and swiftly disappeared. Yet
in that flash Hugh had recognized him; it was that sinister
individual, the Rat.</p>

<p>Hugh went for a walk in the Condamine and did not
return until half past ten. He glanced down to the
terrace; hunched on the bench, a solitary figure, the
girl still slept.</p>

<p>When he got back to the pension, he found it strangely
upset. The two Swedish ladies were going off in a fiacre
with their baggage. Their faces were very red, and
they gabbled furiously. The Twitcher and the Sword-Swallower
were talking in low tones. The Rat was nowhere
to be seen.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” whispered Teresa, the waitress, “I shouldn’t
tell you, but madame and mademoiselle have left us. They
say some one has gone into their room and stolen money.
It was done this afternoon. Fortunately for me I was
away at the time. It is very annoying. <i>Voila!</i> it is evident
we have in the house a thief.”</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER FIVE<br />


THE THIEF</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">HUGH was preparing to leave the Pension Paoli.
Its increasing atmosphere of furtiveness and suspicion
was getting on his nerves. He had taken
a large, sunny unfurnished room in the Condamine and
had bought a folding bed, a table, a chair, and some cooking
utensils. Here he would be alone and quite free. He
would spend his days in sketching, his evenings in reading.</p>

<p>He was considering all this as he sat on a bench on
the terrace just above that green promontory where they
shot the pigeons. Even as he watched the slaughter was
going on. A nimble lad would run out by one of the red,
radiating paths and put a pigeon into one of the grey
boxes; then he would retire and after a short interval
the side of the box would collapse, leaving a bewildered
bird facing an overwhelming freedom. Sometimes the bird
would hop around stupidly, fearing to rise until a rubber
ball bounding towards it hastened its decision. <i>Bang!
Bang!</i> Generally the bird would drop on the green turf,
to be swiftly retrieved by an eager dog. Sometimes, however,
it would get away and, minus a tail, circle over the
sea, finally rejoining its fellows in front of the Casino.
When a pigeon escaped, Hugh wanted to applaud for
joy. But few escaped, and he was turning away in disgust
when he saw the Calderbrooks.</p>

<p>“Hullo!” he said, “I’m surprised. I thought you’d
gone long ago.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>“No,” said Mrs. Calderbrook, “we decided to extend
our stay. It’s really a lovely little place. We find the
Casino so fascinating. We go there every day now.”</p>

<p>“Do you still play?”</p>

<p>“Oh, a little. Just for chicken-feed though. Father
makes enough to pay for his cigarettes, while I generally
get the Casino to stand afternoon tea. Oh, we’re very
careful.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mr. Calderbrook in his soft refined voice.
“One has to be careful if one goes every day. However,
an old fellow called Bender has taught me a system that
so far has been very successful. You put three pieces on
the passe and two on the first dozen, or three pieces on
the manque and two on the last dozen. You have only
six numbers against you. It’s safe.”</p>

<p>“By the way,” said Mrs. Calderbrook, “we saw an
American break the bank yesterday, a Mr. Fetterstein.
He played the number seventeen in every possible way,
staking the maximum. They had to ring for more money.
It was quite interesting. He must have won over a hundred
thousand francs. Well, Father, we’ll leave you with
Mr. Kildair to finish your pipe, while Alice and I go in
to try our luck.”</p>

<p>When they had gone Mr. Calderbrook talked of various
subjects, until suddenly dropping his voice, he said:</p>

<p>“You see that man in black coming along the terrace—the
tall thin one.”</p>

<p>“The one with the clean-shaven face and the fixed
smile?”</p>

<p>“Yes. That’s the great Krantz, the Chief of the Secret
Police.”</p>

<p>As he passed them the eyes of Krantz were focussed on
their faces.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>“There,” said Mr. Calderbrook, “he knew we were discussing
him.”</p>

<p>Hugh looked after the detective. His right hand, held
behind his back, was carrying what looked like a sword
cane. It was a long and muscular hand, and Hugh noted
that part of the little finger was missing.</p>

<p>“They say,” said Mr. Calderbrook, “that he has all
kinds of spies working for him and that he is quite unscrupulous.
People who displease him have a way of
disappearing suddenly. But then everything is high-handed
about this place. It is beyond the law. All kinds
of strange things can be done here and hushed up, all
kinds of crimes go unpunished. It seems to be run quite
irresponsibly. The Casino is supreme and rules with a
high hand. All it cares for is to get money....”</p>

<p>Mr. Calderbrook began to bore him, and Hugh excused
himself. He returned to the pension to prepare for
his departure.</p>

<p>“To-morrow,” he thought, “I shall go away and all
these people will pass out of my existence. It is pleasant
to think one can put them so quietly out of one’s life.
Ah! the beauty of liberty!”</p>

<p>He felt that he could not bear to remain more than one
more night under the same roof with the Rat. The
Twitcher and the Sword-Swallower were to be tolerated,
but the Rat made him shudder. There are people who
make us wish the world was bigger, that we might have
more room to avoid them. The Rat was one of these;
his very proximity was physically disagreeable. His skin
was the colour of the fresh Gruyère cheese, except where
his eye sockets darkened to chocolate. Criminal or not
the man suggested reptilian perversions.</p>

<p>When Hugh paid his modest bill, he received a thousand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
francs in change, and as he stuffed the small notes
into his pocket-book, he was aware that the sharp eyes
of the Rat were upon him.</p>

<p>It was after ten o’clock and the Pension Paoli was very
quiet. All the boarders were apparently at the Casino.
The big building seemed deserted.</p>

<p>Leaving the door of his room ajar, Hugh threw himself
on his bed. Soon he heard the street door open and some
one pass upstairs. It was the Rat.</p>

<p>As he lay in the darkness, and listened to the sounds of
the great gloomy house, a strange feeling of uneasiness
began to creep over him. This grew so strong that after
a bit he rose and went out on his little balcony. The air
was exquisite. Over him flowed the river of night, and
looking up into its lucid depths he saw the sky, its bed,
pebbled with stars. Then his eyes drifted to the myriad
lights that lay between him and the sea, lights now clear,
now confused into a luminous mist....</p>

<p>What was that? Surely some one was moving softly
in the passage? No; he was not wrong. Some one was
trying the door of the next room, the Twitcher’s. But
the Twitcher had locked it, and after one or two efforts
the sound ceased.</p>

<p>Then Hugh had an inspiration. Taking out his pocket-book
he threw it on the bed. Enough light came from the
window to show it black against the white counterpane.
There! the trap was baited.</p>

<p>Footsteps again in the passage, fumbling, muffled. They
were drawing nearer, they were opposite his door. In the
darkness he heard hard, hurried breathing. His own
heart was tapping like a hammer. Surely the footsteps
were passing? No, they had halted. Then slowly, slowly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
his door was pushed open, and a black stealthy form crept
to his bed.</p>

<p>He held his breath, and waited.... Now the dark
shape was close.... Now an arm reached out, and a
hand seized the pocket-book.... Now....</p>

<p>Hugh leapt forward and closed the door. He was alone
in the darkness with the intruder. He had done it. The
Rat was trapped.</p>

<p>“You dirty sneak-thief, I’ve got you,” he cried.</p>

<p>He switched on the electricity, and the room leaped
into light. Against the far wall, cowering and clutching
at it for support, was a figure in a black hood and cape.</p>

<p>Then it was Hugh’s turn to start back and utter a
cry of dismay.</p>

<p>For framed in the black hood, and gazing at him wild-eyed
with fear, was Margot Leblanc.</p>

THERE WAS A LONG SILENCE</h3>
</div>

<h4>1.</h4>

<p class="drop-cap">SHRINKING against the wall the girl looked up
at him, her face sick with terror. Amazement
turned him to stone. Then suddenly he recovered
himself; and his astonishment changed to disgust.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said in a hard voice, “caught you in the
act, didn’t I?”</p>

<p>She did not answer.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, very sorry. I’d rather it had been any
one else. Tell me, is there any reason I shouldn’t hand
you over to the police?”</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>“Speak, please. Is there any reason?...”</p>

<p>Her arms dropped. She straightened up, and looked
him full in the face.</p>

<p>“There is. I’m starving. I haven’t tasted food for
two days....” Then she sank at his feet.</p>


<h4>2.</h4>

<p>Two hours later they were in a lonely corner of a restaurant.
She had satisfied her hunger, and was sitting
silent, downcast, sullen.</p>

<p>He looked at her with keen, bright eyes. “Poor little
devil!” he thought, “perhaps she isn’t so bad after all.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
Then aloud he said: “I suppose when you went to the
Twitcher’s room your intention was to steal?”</p>

<p>She hesitated. After all, what did it matter? “Yes,”
she answered. “I went down there to steal.”</p>

<p>“You also stole the money belonging to the Swede
women....”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t do that. I swear I didn’t....”</p>

<p>He looked at her steadily. He did not believe her.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do now?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“What’s going to become of you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>He leaned back, his hands clasping his knee. He noted
a tress of bright gold hair coiling over her hollow cheek.</p>

<p>“I mustn’t leave her to her fate,” he thought.</p>

<p>Bending forward he said impulsively: “Look here, let
me lend you some money.”</p>

<p>A deep flush stained her cheek. He, too, was one of
them ... the beasts. Sharply she answered:</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Because I don’t choose to accept your aid.”</p>

<p>“It seems to me you’re not in a position to refuse it;
you haven’t a <i>sou</i>. To-morrow you’re to be turned out
of your room. Madam will certainly keep all your belongings.
You will have nowhere to go. You have no
friends here. You are not fit to do any work. You are
on the verge of a break-down. Again I ask ... what’s
going to become of you?”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t matter.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it does. Look here ... suppose I lay a charge
against you of entering my room with intent to steal,—will
you deny it?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>“No.”</p>

<p>“Well then, you are in my power. You must submit
to my conditions.”</p>

<p>She looked at him sullenly. “What are they?”</p>

<p>“I’m not going to lend you any money, but I am going
to help you in my own way. First of all, I want you to
promise me that you will never enter the Casino again.”</p>

<p>She laughed bitterly. “I’ll promise that. I hate the
place.”</p>

<p>“Now, I’m taking a room in the Condamine. I want
you to come there and be my housekeeper.”</p>

<p>She could not keep the contempt out of her eyes.</p>

<p>“Don’t look at me like that,” he said sharply. “I see
you don’t understand.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean ... <i>that</i>?”</p>

<p>“No, damn it, I don’t mean—<i>that</i>.”</p>

<p>She looked at him with new interest, steadily, wonderingly.
He went on: “It’s a big room. We’ll divide it
into three, with screens and curtains. There will be your
part, and my part, and a common one to be used as a
kitchen and dining-room. Don’t fear. You’ll be as safe
behind your curtain as if you were in a room with doors
double-locked.”</p>

<p>She had never met a man like this. Wonder widened
her eyes. He laughed to see it, a frank boyish laugh.</p>

<p>“Sounds crazy, doesn’t it? I don’t see why it won’t
work, though. If I were a Frenchman, it surely wouldn’t.
But we Anglo-Saxons are a cold-blooded lot. We’re
idealists, given to doing strange, mad things. I give
you my word of honour I will respect you as I would a
sister. There you have it. We will be brother and sister.
We are enough alike to pass for that. I had intended to
do my own cooking, but that will be your job now. Then,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
while you are resting quietly and getting back your health,
I will attack the Casino and get back your money.”</p>

<p>“How will you do that?”</p>

<p>“By playing. I hate to play, but if I do I have an
idea I can win. At least I can afford to risk a thousand
francs and with that I propose to win back the two thousand
you need to take you to Paris.”</p>

<p>“No, no. You mustn’t play. No one ever wins there.
You’ll lose everything.”</p>

<p>“Leave it to me. Come on now, it’s decided. That
you trust me, is all I ask. Everything will come out
right. In six weeks I promise you I’ll send you back to
Paris with enough money to start your little shop.
Brother and sister,—<i>n’est ce pas?</i>”</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders helplessly. “I am in your
hands. You can do with me as you will.”</p>

<p>Again he laughed that boyish laugh. “There! don’t
look so tragic. Everything’s lovely. Come on, we’ll get
back to the pension.”</p>

<p>They walked in silence through the exotic gardens.
The pink clock in the tower of the Casino pointed to half
an hour after midnight; the shutters were descending over
the entrance doors. He looked at the place with a new
interest. Hitherto it had meant nothing to him. Now
he saw in it an antagonist. He was looking on a battle-ground
where he would win or fall. On the morrow the
fight would begin.</p>

<p>So absorbed was he that he forgot the girl by his side.
Then a soft sound aroused him. He looked down and
saw that she was crying.</p>

THE TEMPLE OF CHANCE</h3>
</div>

<h4>1.</h4>

<p class="drop-cap">MONTE CARLO is various kinds of a jewel.
In the morning it glitters like a diamond;
in the afternoon it gleams like a great pearl of
the Orient; in the evening it glows with the mellow lustre
of a sapphire. It has its moods of invincible beauty.
There are times when one wonders if it is real and not
the fabric of a dream. But of all its moods its glamour
is, perhaps, most felt in that mellow moment that precedes
the setting of the sun. From earth and sky
exhales a great serenity. In the golden air, a thousand
windows shine like casements of romance, the sea
melts placidly into the tranquil sky, and the mountains
breathe tenderness and calm.</p>

<p>It was at such a moment, reassuring to the soul, that
Hugh, for the first time, mounted the seven steps that led
to the temple of chance. The sun gleamed on the brass
rods of the carpet, gleamed on the gold braid of the four
porters who guarded the entrance, gleamed on the buttons
of the little page boys that swung open the double doors.
Behind the glass partition, leaning on a brass rail, and
scrutinizing every one who climbed the steps, were three
detectives. Characteristic of the place,—the eager welcome;
the watching detectives!</p>

<p>Hugh mounted the steps and paused at the top, just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
as he had seen so many others pause to look over the
scene.</p>

<p>Beyond the “Cheese,” the central garden was a vivid
emerald, enamelled with patterns of pansies; a breeze, pure
and delicious, rustled the palms. Daintily dressed children
were throwing crumbs to the lethargic pigeons. A
shining Rolls Royce floated past and anchored in front
of the Hotel de Paris, while a tall negro in a swallow-tail
uniform descended in stately fashion and opened its doors.
The space in front of the Café de Paris was starred with
striped umbrellas and coloured with gay groups. The
Roumanian orchestra was playing with sparkling abandon
and a crowd was whirling around the “Cheese.” The
English dominated the throng;—tall, thin women with
patrician noses, tall, thin men with grey hair and lean,
fresh faces. It was a suave picture of elegance and ease.</p>

<p>Turning to the left Hugh entered the bureau of admission.
The Nice train had just come in and behind the
high curved counter the clerks cowered before the clamouring
crowd. Seated at a commanding desk was the
chief of the bureau, an owl like man with a crabbed air;
he was the final arbitror, the judge from whom there was
no appeal. Before him was a Swiss aubergiste who was
trying to explain that if the clothes he wore were not
good enough for the Casino, he could change them for
better. Another rejected one, a stout woman who had
foolishly given her occupation as a dress-maker, was pointing
out that the lady ahead of her who had just been
granted a card was a <i>femme galante</i>, one of her clients
who even owed her money. But to such protests no attention
was paid. A blank look, a shrug of the shoulders,—that
was all. Judged by Casino standards and found
wanting, they had to go away disconsolate.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>Hugh, however, had no such trouble. A brisk little
interpreter bustled up; and he slipped a bill into the
man’s hand. He was pushed forward in front of the
others.</p>

<p>“This gentleman is known to me,” said the interpreter
with fluent audacity. “He is a celebrated <i>artist dramatic
de Londres</i>.”</p>

<p>So Hugh assumed the air of a <i>jeune premier</i>, and with
many polite smiles was handed a card.</p>

<p>“Now,” he murmured, “for the next step in the gambler’s
progress!” A courteous flunkey ushered him into
the atrium, a galleried hall designed to impress the visitor
and put him in the proper frame of mind to enter the
Rooms. It was of staid richness, of sober dignity.
Through a vista of marble columns Hugh saw a circular
refreshment counter, and nearby a bulletin board where
a group were reading the latest despatches from the ends
of the earth. On leather-padded benches men were smoking
cigarettes, and women gossiping and criticizing all
who passed. Other men and women strolled up and down,
taking a breath of air after a strenuous spell at the
tables. He overheard scraps of conversation.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve made my day, but the bank gave me a hard
fight for it.” “Yes, a martingale’s deadly. It will always
get you in the end.”</p>

<p>Looking towards the left he saw three mysterious doors.
From the center one a stream of people was pouring, with
an expression on their faces of either impassivity or disgust,
elation was rare. By the side doors another crowd
was entering. Those to the left were eager and excited;
those to the right calm and blasé. These were the respective
doors for the visitor and the habitué. It was
through the visitors’ door that Hugh passed. At last!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
He was on the threshold of the greatest gambling room on
earth.</p>

<p>First impression,—nasal. How could people breathe
such air? It struck him like a blow in the face. It
was so thick, so richly human,—a compound of physical
exhalations, cheap cosmetics and disease. It almost
daunted him. Second impression,—oral. A confused
murmur of many voices. A discreet rumble,
punctuated by the acrid cries of the croupiers and the
click of rakes on counters. Third impression,—visual.
To the right and left were walls of human backs surrounding
pools of light. The light came from green
shaded lamps that hung from heavy cords. Peering over
a triple row of shoulders he caught a glimpse of a green
table and a scuttling ball.</p>

<p>He passed through a smaller room into a great central
one. In contrast with the restful dignity of the atrium
it was of a brilliant beauty. Huge columns of honey-coloured
onyx seemed to strike the note of the decoration.
Everything was in the same key, from the padded
seats of yellow leather to the Watteau-like panels painted
on the wall. Two immense chandeliers were tangles of gilt
on which lights clustered like grapes on a vine. Everything
seemed to shine, glisten, reflect. Even the inlaid
floor was lustrous with the polish of a million gliding
feet. Just as he had called the smaller room by the entrance
the “Grey Room,” so he called this the “Hall of
Light.” From the gleaming floor to the vast dome it
suggested light.</p>

<p>There were five tables, and each was besieged by gamblers.
Those in the outer row stretched and strained to
get their money on the table, marking the numbers in
glazed note-books, shouting their manner of staking,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
squabbling and scrambling for their gains. Hugh felt a
little bewildered.</p>

<p>As he stood there a very curious thing happened. A tall,
distinguished-looking woman, wearing a cream-coloured
mantle, advanced to the centre of the hall. She took from
under her mantle a plate of white china and deliberately
let it fall to the floor. At the sharp crash those nearest
turned, and in an instant she was surrounded by a curious
crowd. Then as quietly as she had come she backed out
and disappeared. Two attendants in light blue came forward
and calmly gathered up the debris. The crowd,
laughing, returned to the tables.</p>

<p>While Hugh was wondering what it meant, the affable
little Mr. Jarvis Tope bustled up to him. Mr. Tope wore
a white waistcoat and white spats, and was, as the French
say, “pinned at the four corners.” His round red face
was wreathed in a smile of welcome.</p>

<p>“Ha! young man, so at last you venture into the cave
of the dragon. Well, it’s good to see a fresh face among
so many stale ones. What was all the excitement about?”</p>

<p>Hugh told him of the lady and the plate. Tope
laughed.</p>

<p>“Oh, is that all! Didn’t you know that to break china
on the floor of the Casino is supposed to change one’s
luck? It’s rather a desperate resort. The lady you saw
must have been hard hit. Women believe in those things,
mascots and so on. They bet on the number of their cloakroom
check; they have their favourite tables and believe
that the croupier can control the ball. Every woman who
believes in any of these things is a fool; it’s astonishing
how many are fools. Come, I’ll explain the game to
you.”</p>

<p>Going to what Mr. Tope called the “Suicide Table,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
they pushed themselves into the triple row of standing
spectators till they were behind the seat holders. These
had a sphynx-like air of absorption. Piles of counters were
methodically stacked before them, and their little note-books
were scrupulously neat. Some were marking down
dots and zig-zag lines, some columns of figures. They
played occasionally and with deliberation. They were the
regulars, the system workers, who sat every day in the
same place at the same table.</p>

<p>While Mr. Tope was explaining the different methods
of playing, Hugh felt a light touch on his arm. Looking
round he saw a sweet if somewhat over-emphasized face
smiling up at him. The girl wore a bonnet that seemed
to be made of tiny lilac flowers, and her hands were daintily
gloved. Hugh thought at first that she had mistaken
him for somebody else.</p>

<p>“Listen, Monsieur. Lend me a louis. It will bring
you luck.”</p>

<p>But Mr. Tope frowned. “Don’t do it. Pretend you
have no money.”</p>

<p>Hugh awkwardly refused, and with a little grimace the
girl went away.</p>

<p>“One of the parasites of the place,” said Mr. Tope.
“The Casino’s full of them. She spotted you at once for
a newcomer. She’s on the watch for greenhorns. Now
she’ll tell her sisterhood that you turned her down, and
you’ll be less pestered. Never speak to a woman you
don’t know on the floor of the Casino. In the end it will
cost you money.”</p>

<p>“I wonder the management doesn’t stop that sort of
thing.”</p>

<p>“They encourage everything that speeds up the gambling.
Morality doesn’t exist as far as they are concerned.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
All they want is to get your coin; and in the
end they usually do.”</p>

<p>“Do they get yours?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I lose sometimes. There’s a class of people
who tell you they never lose. They’re known as the liars.”</p>

<p>“That was a very pretty girl who spoke to me.”</p>

<p>“Yes. There’s a story about her. She was engaged
to a Frenchman who went to America and established himself
in business. He sent her money to buy her trousseau,
and to pay her passage over. She was crazy about him,
all eagerness to join him; but she was tempted to risk a
little of the money at the tables. In the end she lost it
all. She dared not tell him, so she never answered his
letters. Since then she has lived a hectic existence. She’s
an incurable gambler. A ruined life.... But come, I
want to introduce you to two of the oldest habitués of the
Rooms, veterans like myself. Mr. Galloway MacTaggart
of Strathbungo.”</p>

<p>Hugh was forthwith presented to a tall wiry man, who
enveloped his hand in a large dry grip. He had a grim
spectacled face and thin-grey whiskers.</p>

<p>“Welcome, malad,” said Mr. MacTaggart. “The Fraternal
Order o’ the Veeatic bids ye welcome tae this den o’
ineequity. And noo, if ye’ll alloo me, I’ll present ye tae
the Grand Maister, Mr. Gimp o’ Cincinnati. Mr. Gimp
has the disteenction o’ bein’ the auldest member.”</p>

<p>Mr. Gimp was small and wiry. He was the neatest
man Hugh had ever seen; even his eyes were neat. He
had a puckered pink face, and white silky hair like the
floss of the thistle. His moustache was like a wisp of
cotton. He extracted the thumb of his right hand from
the armhole of his waistcoat and presented two fingers
for Hugh to wag solemnly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>“Gimp’s feeling peevish,” said Mr. Tope. “He’s just
won five francs and lost ten.”</p>

<p>“Never play the goddamn game,” snorted Mr. Gimp.
“When you catch me putting a cent on those tables, you
can call me a goddamn fool and kick me round the ‘Camembert.’”</p>

<p>“Well, after coming here for thirty years without missing
a season you ought to have enough of it.”</p>

<p>“Darned sight too much. No place for a respectable
man! Never enter the Rooms unless I’m obliged to. Just
come in now to look for a friend. A hotbed of crooks
and courtesans. Yes, and spies. Look at that damn inspector
edging nearer to see if he can’t hear what we are
talking about. Bah! Look at that woman now. Why,
she’d make a rotten egg smell like a rose. Well, I can’t
stand it any longer. I’m off to breathe God’s good air.
Au revoir.”</p>

<p>With that Mr. Gimp stalked virtuously away. “He’s
always like that,” remarked Mr. MacTaggart dryly. “An’
if ye come in the Casino an ’oor from noo ye’ll find him
smokin’ his cigarette in the atrium. He’s one o’ the fixtures
o’ the place. It wouldna’ be complete withoot him.
An’ there’s a whole lot mair in the same boax. A man
frae Brazeel went aff his heid in the Rooms the ither day.
‘Puir Chap!’ they were a-sayin’, but I telt them, ‘He’s
nae worse nor the rest o’ us. We’re a’ daft in this establishment.’
Whit’s yer impression o’ it, young man?”</p>

<p>“I’m surprised to see so many old people in the Rooms.”</p>

<p>“That’s right. Gamblin’s the last infirmity of ignoble
minds. When folks are ower dodderin’ for wine an’ wimmen,
gamblin’s a’ that’s left tae them. Look at that
auld Bianca there. They say she wis the mistress o’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
the King o’ Italy. Whit things she must hae seen!
Noo she goes roon like a spectre mumblin’ an’ breakin’
wind every time she plays. Weel, I’m feelin’ auld an’
tired masel. Ma nerves are no whit they were. There’s
nae doot it gets ye. It’s a crool, crool game....”</p>

<p>They sought the fresher air of the atrium and lighting
their cigarettes sat down on a recessed divan of padded
leather.</p>

<p>“MacTaggart is our great hope,” said Mr. Tope. “He
is patience and pertinacity personified. He has now been
sitting at the same place at the same table from the beginning
of the play to the end for two years.”</p>

<p>“For three years,” said Mr. MacTaggart. “I’ve got
the record o’ two hundred thoosand consecutive <i>coups</i>.”</p>

<p>“MacTaggart claims he knows more about roulette
than all the rest of us put together.”</p>

<p>“So I do. Ye’re like a lot o’ children. Ye ken naethin’.
When ye’ve spent night after night for three years
compilin’ an’ analyzin’ permanencies, ye’ll begin tae hae
some glimmerin’ o’ the mysterious workin’s o’ the laws o’
chance. I’ve studied the game noo for twenty years and
I’m jist beginnin’ tae know a little, a verry little.”</p>

<p>“Look!” said Mr. Tope, “there’s that poor little Emslie
girl waiting as usual for her mother.”</p>

<p>On one of the benches near the exit from the Rooms
Hugh saw a slight girl with a very sweet face. Her chestnut
hair was braided behind and her colouring was fresh,
and girlish. She sat with her slim hands clasped in her
lap, looking anxious and forlorn.</p>

<p>“That,” said Mr. Tope, who seemed to know everything
and everybody, “is one of the hardest cases. She’s only
sixteen, and has been left a few thousand pounds by her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
grandfather. But her mother’s a gambler <i>enragée</i>.
She’s lost all her own money, and now they say she’s playing
with the girl’s.”</p>

<p>At that moment a woman came from the Rooms, and
the girl ran to her eagerly. The woman was tall and
handsome, and her face was alight with joy. Opening
her gold chain bag, she showed the girl the contents.
They both laughed, almost hysterically, and went off arm
in arm. With a start Hugh recognized the cream-coloured
cape; it was the lady who had broken the plate.</p>


<h4>2.</h4>

<p>In the days that followed Hugh came to know the great
building intimately. He gave fanciful names to the various
Rooms. Beyond the “Hall of Light,” as he called
the main gambling room, was the “Hall of Gloom.” In
decoration it was heavy, dark, depressing. There was
something Teutonic about it, even to the panels of lumpish
Amazons that filled in the wall spaces. On the only
occasion he played there, he came away whistling the
“Dead March.”</p>

<p>To the right of the “Hall of Light” was a little gem
of a room which contained only one table. He called it
the “Room of the Opium Dreamer,” on account of the
exquisitely painted ceiling of naked nymphs voluptuously
sprawling on fleecy clouds. Its windows looked on the
terrace and often he pulled aside the silken blind to marvel
at the radiant beauty of the sea. The air in this
room was unusually bad.</p>

<p>Beyond this was what he called the “Hall of the Three
Graces,” on account of the huge wall panel that dominated
it. It represented three nude women against a Florentine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
background. Mr. Tope gave him some curious information
about this picture.</p>

<p>“These,” he said, “were three <i>demi-mondaines</i>, frequenters
of the Casino. They claimed to be Swiss: but it turned
out that they were Austrian spies in the pay of Germany.”</p>

<p>Hugh looked at them with a new interest.</p>

<p>“When war was declared all three cleared out in a
hurry. The directer himself had to get away. He had,
they say, gotten the Casino Company to acquire the golf
links on Mont Agel, and right under the eyes of the French
garrison he had all prepared for the installation of a wireless
outfit. It was an ex-captain of Uhlans. His son
made a demonstration in favour of Germany in front of
the Casino and was mobbed.... Oh, this was a great
place before the war, a hotbed of treason. I’m told the
French Government had to put pressure on the Government
of Monaco to clear them out. And now they’re
creeping back again.”</p>


<h4>3.</h4>

<p>Hugh soon came to recognize the various types that frequented
the place. The women known as the skimmers
particularly interested him. They haunted the Rooms,
hovering over the tables and waiting for a chance to grab
the stakes of others. They were the cause of most of
the disputes. In the course of an afternoon a dozen of
these rows would occur. As a rule, the croupiers discreetly
professed ignorance of the cause. Although the
disputants often called one another nasty names, Hugh
saw them come to blows only on one occasion.</p>

<p>A Russian woman, said to be a princess ruined by the
Bolshevics, was playing steadily. Twice a Frenchwoman
with a face like a bulldog, reached out and grabbed her winning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
stake. The Russian looked puzzled, but said nothing;
she only watched and waited. As the Frenchwoman
reached forward a third time she cried “Thief!”</p>

<p>The Frenchwoman promptly slapped her face. The
Russian looked at her in steady contempt, shrugged her
shoulders and turned to go. Then a fury seized her, and
swinging round, she struck the Frenchwoman a violent
blow, clutched at her hat, her hair, tugged, scratched,
slapped, a very wild cat of fury. The attendants separated
them. The Russian was marched off; the Frenchwoman
dried her tears and declared triumphantly that
the other would lose her ticket. But presently when the
attendants returned, she, too, was led off. Hugh never
saw either of them in the Casino again.</p>

<p>He spent long hours studying the play. He took down
numbers and poured over the permanencies. He felt
quite at home now. He had a monthly card, and was
confident, even eager to begin. One evening he left the
Rooms with his mind made up.</p>

<p>“To-morrow I cease to be a spectator. To-morrow I
commence to play.”</p>

A GAMBLER’S DÉBUT</h3>
</div>

<h4>1.</h4>

<p class="drop-cap">“MARGOT, would you mind coming here a moment?”</p>

<p>The girl was drying her hands after washing
the supper dishes. “Yes, monsieur.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I say, I wish you wouldn’t call me ‘monsieur.’ It
sounds as if I were treating you like a servant.”</p>

<p>The girl was silent. Hugh went on.</p>

<p>“Why can’t you call me by my first name, as I do you?
If you don’t, I shall think you dislike me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, please don’t think that. I would do anything to
please you.”</p>

<p>“Then why be so unfriendly?”</p>

<p>“I don’t mean to. But ... it’s hard.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Well ... there’s such a difference between us. I
am only a poor girl, a nobody. You are....”</p>

<p>“No better than you are. Perhaps I’ve had just as
hard a struggle in life as you have. I’ve always been
poor. I’m poor now. I want to think you are my little
sister, and I am your big brother. You must do the
same.”</p>

<p>“I’ll try. Please give me a little time. Perhaps, it
will be easier.”</p>

<p>“All right. And now please come here. I’d like you
to look at something.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>He was sitting at the table with a big green book before
him. Each page was filled with columns and columns
of figures. His face was eager, his eyes sparkling.</p>

<p>“You know, I’m going to begin playing to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Oh, please don’t. It’s terrible how it gets a hold of
you. And in the end it always means ruin.”</p>

<p>“You don’t know me. I’m a pretty obstinate sort of
chap. I’m going to gamble. Maybe I wanted to do so
all along, and only waited for the excuse you’ve given me.”</p>

<p>“What excuse?”</p>

<p>“To win back the money you lost.”</p>

<p>“You’re not going to gamble on my account.”</p>

<p>“Of course, I am.”</p>

<p>“I will refuse to take the money.”</p>

<p>“All the same I am going to win it.”</p>

<p>“After that you’ll stop?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.... There, don’t be so frightened.
Come closer and look at these figures.”</p>

<p>On a sheet of paper he had made the following diagram:</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_146.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>“The seven dots,” he explained, “represent a run of
seven or more on any of the simple chances. The run<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
breaks as you see, then returns once again. It’s a well-known
formation. Well, I’ve got to get that before I
begin to play.”</p>

<p>“But it doesn’t happen very often,—only three or four
times at a table in the course of the day’s play.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I have the run of all the tables, fourteen of
them. I can range the whole place. By glancing over
the shoulders of those who are taking numbers, I can tell
if there is anything in my line. When I find the combination
I am seeking, I start staking in louis the sums
I have marked.”</p>

<p>“You only stake one the second time....”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s a buffer. I neither win nor lose if I gain
that coup. I have to do that in order to ease up on my
progression. Otherwise it would increase too rapidly.
Then on the third, fourth, and fifth terms of my progression,
I stand to win a louis only, but on the sixth term
I win two louis, and on the seventh term, four. I use
this progression because I have only a hundred louis at
my disposal. I want to make a progression of seven
terms, and I want my gains to increase as my stake increases.
The great defect of the ordinary martingale is
that you often find yourself obliged to risk quite a big
sum to win a single unit.”</p>

<p>She continued to look at the figures frowningly.</p>

<p>“You see,” he went on eagerly, “to beat me the bank
will have to follow up the first big run of seven or more
by a second of eight, after a single break. Now I have
examined a book of the records of the play at the second
table for a whole year, and I haven’t found a single case
of this happening. So you see, I feel pretty safe. I only
want to make three wins a day, three louis. At that rate,
in about seven weeks I shall have all your money back.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
You can return to Paris, start your shop, and live happily
ever after. Great scheme, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“What if you lose?”</p>

<p>“I can’t. It isn’t conceivable.”</p>

<p>“In roulette it’s always the inconceivable that happens.”</p>

<p>“No, I’m quite convinced. Armed with this system, I
am going to the Casino just as confidently as if I were
going to draw money from the bank. Of course, I know
it means patience, watching, walking miles between tables;
but that will be fun. I don’t want to win too easily.”</p>

<p>He continued to pore over his records, and she went
softly about her work. When she had finished she looked
toward him. In the shaded lamp-light his face was joyously
eager; he was tapping his white teeth with his pencil,
and his eyes were absorbed.</p>

<p>“Good-night,” she said timidly.</p>

<p>“Good-night,” he answered absently, without looking up.</p>


<h4>2.</h4>

<p>He worked very late over his permanencies and awoke
to bright sunshine, and the fragrance of fresh coffee.</p>

<p>He had divided the room in two by a heavy green curtain.
The part with the door and the little <i>cabinet de
cuisine</i> was the living part; the other was for sleeping.
This he had divided still further by a grey curtain so
that they each had a little compartment with a bed. The
girl seemed doubtful of this arrangement at first.</p>

<p>“I don’t see why it matters,” he said indignantly,
“whether there is a curtain or a three foot wall between
us. Remember we are brother and sister. Honour and
decency are better protectors than bolts and bars.”</p>

<p>With this fine sentiment he disposed of her objections.
There was no doubt he thoroughly believed it; and when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
he retired more or less weary behind his curtain, he slept
as calmly as if he were alone in the room.</p>

<p>On this particular morning, having slept late and well,
he rose light-heartedly, singing as he dressed. When he
entered that part of the room that served them in common,
he found that Margot had set his breakfast on the
table, and was preparing to go to market. She was
dressed like the women of the country, with a shawl over
her bright hair. Each morning she would ask him:</p>

<p>“What would you like for lunch?”</p>

<p>“Oh, anything; I don’t care.”</p>

<p>“No, don’t say you don’t care. You know I like to
please you.”</p>

<p>Then he would think profoundly. “I tell you what,
... Give me ... a surprise.”</p>

<p>With a gesture of despair she would go away. She
was rather a good cook, but he seldom noticed what he
ate. Now he stopped her as she was going out. “Had
your breakfast?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, long ago.”</p>

<p>“I wish you would call me in the morning so that we
can take it together. I like you to talk to me while I’m
eating. Sit down and talk now. You’re not in such a
hurry. Come, take a cigarette.”</p>

<p>“You know I never smoke.”</p>

<p>“I wish you would. It’s so chummy. Anyway, sit
down. That’s right. Your hair’s lovely when it glistens
in the sunshine. You know, you’re looking ever so
much better already. Your chin is getting round, and
there is actually a delicate rose colour in your cheeks.
Your face is far more English than French. Some day
if you’ll pose for me, I’ll paint you. This coffee’s awfully
nice....” As he rattled on in his gay manner, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
girl listened with a grave smile. There was a curious look
in her eyes, a tenderness almost maternal.</p>

<p>“I say,” he went on, “I didn’t tell you I went to the
Pension Paoli yesterday. I had a talk with Terese, the
black-eyed Terese. She gave me some news.”</p>

<p>“Yes, what?”</p>

<p>“You remember that unsavoury sort of a chap who
made such a bad impression on everybody,—I used to call
him the Rat.”</p>

<p>“I never liked him.”</p>

<p>“Well, do you know what the mystery was that seemed
to surround him? The poor harmless fellow was a priest,
a <i>curé</i> who had slipped away from his flock, dressed in
everyday clothes, and was having a good time. I don’t
blame him, poor devil. He wanted to be free, to taste life
just once, before going back to his black skirts and his
prayer-book. I expect he’s doing bitter penance for it
now. He was recognized by an old abbé and there was no
end of a row. He was haled off by two burly priests,
crying like a child.”</p>

<p>“It just shows how one should never judge people.”</p>

<p>“And you remember those two Swede women?”</p>

<p>“They enjoyed eating so much.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and they declared some one had entered their
room and stolen money? That, too, was wrong. The
mother came the other day to the pension and told madame
the money had been found. The girl had put it between
the pages of a very dull novel. When she came to
finish the book she found the bills. So all’s well that ends
well.” The girl said nothing. She remembered that he had
once suspected her of taking this money, and the thought
still pained her. “Come on,” he continued gaily, “let’s go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
out together. Remember to-day I leap into the arena.
To-day I make my début as a gambler.”</p>


<h4>3.</h4>

<p>It was half past ten when Hugh entered the Casino.</p>

<p>The Rooms in the forenoon presented a very different
aspect from the one with which he was familiar. The air,
though stagnant, was not obnoxious. The rumble of
voices was subdued to a discreet hum. Only five roulette
tables were running. Every one had an air of knowing
every one else. In place of the fever and scrabble of the
afternoon there was a suave and amiable courtesy. The
regular Monte Carloites were taking advantage of the
morning calm to play their systems. Hugh stood by the
table where the majority of the system-players were.
They were mostly ageing men, neatly dressed, bespectacled,
business-like. The records in their tiny note-books
were scrupulously kept from day to day. They
played but seldom, and then generally with flat stakes.
At the end of the season their books showed probably
only modest gains. The little old lady who took down the
numbers for the Monte Carlo Gazette worked at this table.
Every day, year after year, she sat there, dressed in rusty
black, looking rather sour. She made quite a lot of money
by giving up her place for a small consideration to any
who would pay for it.</p>

<p>Next to Hugh stood a very shabby old man. His
trousers were baggy and frayed, his braid-trimmed coat
of a pattern of a bygone day. He had a weak chin, bulging
eyes, a heavy grey moustache, and a curious air of
faded gentility. He had been pointed out to Hugh as an
Italian nobleman, the Count Viviano, who had gambled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
away all his estates and now lived on a small pension. The
old man stood for a long time gazing at the table in a
strangely absorbed manner. Hugh, who saw things with
an artist’s eye, noticed that his hands had big veins and
a glazed look. They trembled almost constantly and were
the only sign of emotion in a figure otherwise calm.</p>

<p>Suddenly the old man began to fumble in the pocket
of his waistcoat and drew forth a blue oblong placque
representing a thousand francs. He waited till the ball
had been spun, then reaching over unsteadily, placed it
on the first dozen. He tried to look unconcerned. He
lost. Again the ball was spun and again Hugh saw him
fumble, draw out another pale blue placque, and place
it tremblingly on the same dozen as before. Again he
lost. The next time he put a blue placque on both the first
and second dozen. Alas! the third dozen came. He
seemed in doubt whether to stay or go away. His agitation
was pitiable. Again the ball was spun. Many looked
at him to see what he would do. Just at the last moment,
he drew from another pocket two more blue placques, and
put one on the first dozen, the other on the third. Was
ever such infernal luck! The second dozen won.</p>

<p>Curious and commiserating glances were cast at him.</p>

<p>The old count looked dazed. With shaking hands he
took from the inside of his coat a shabby pocket-book
and drew from it all the money it contained, a hundred
franc note and a few small ones. He threw them on the
first dozen. Again he lost. He was broke.</p>

<p>And as he stood there like a man in a dream, as if
to mock him, the first dozen came again and again. Six
times it repeated, and each time the man seemed to grow
older, more crushed, more hopelessly stricken. He continued
to look at the table as if fascinated; then, with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
saddest face Hugh had ever seen, he slowly left the room.</p>

<p>Another figure now attracted the attention of the onlookers.
A tall man was plastering the table with louis
and Hugh recognized Mr. Fetterstein. He looked the
typical captain of industry, solid, powerful, dominating.
His face, slightly Jewish in type, was bold, and massive.
His eyes changed from a twinkle of amusement to a look
of profound concentration. There was something unshakable
about him. He played imperturbably. When he
lost, he laughed; when he gained, he seemed indifferent.
At present he was winning. He had covered the number
fourteen and all its combinations. Fourteen came. He
repeated, again putting the maximum on fourteen. There
was a murmur. Fourteen again. Once more he put the
maximum on fourteen. The croupier who spun the ball
looked nervous and worried. The <i>Chef</i> looked at him with
a frown, as if to say, “There are thirty-five other numbers.
As you value your promotion avoid the fourteen.” Again
the man spun. A great shout went up.... <i>Fourteen</i>.</p>

<p>As he was paid with the usual impressive deliberation,
Mr. Fetterstein folded up the wad of <i>mille</i> notes he had
gained and put them away. He had won over thirty thousand
francs,—but what was that to him, a millionaire? He
went on playing, but the croupier who had been throwing
was changed.</p>

<p>Hugh saw many people whom he knew, among them
the Calderbrook family. The ladies were playing a lively
game and, even this early in the morning, looked rather
excited. On his way out, he passed the forlorn Emslie
girl in the atrium, waiting for her mother, and in the
vestibule, he encountered Mr. Gimp rolling a cigarette.
The little man nodded curtly. His puckered pink face and
his snowy white hair gave the impression of frostiness.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>When Hugh reached home he said to Margot:</p>

<p>“You know, I was so interested watching every one I
forgot to play. Well, this afternoon....”</p>


<h4>4.</h4>

<p>In the afternoon the trains and yellow busses from Nice
had disgorged their tourist hordes and turned the Casino
into a welter of humid humanity. There were cheap-trippers
taking a flutter, skimmers from the slums of
Nice, sight-seers from every land under the sun, flaunting
<i>femmes de luxe</i>, evil faces of the underworld,—the whole
mob of strange invaders which a Monte Carloite finds so
little to his liking. As fourteen tables were running, Hugh
soon found an opportunity to try his system. He made
three wins in the course of two hours. In neither case had
he to fall back on his progression. He was elated and
having finished for the day, amused himself by making
sketches of the crowd.</p>

<p>By and by he wandered to the first trente-et-quarante
table where a big game was going on. An American millionairess
was playing as high as the limit allowed. She
had before her a heap of pink placques, like cakes of soap,
representing five thousand francs each; she tossed them
around as carelessly as if they had no value. At one end
of the table, Hugh noticed a tall distinguished-looking
Englishman with an eye-glass; at the other, the Twitcher.</p>

<p>Hugh was admiring the superb insouciance of the
American woman, who had lost twenty-five thousand
francs in five minutes when he suddenly saw the Twitcher
throw a bundle of mille notes on the red. There were
evidently twelve of them, a maximum. By Jove! the
Twitcher certainly was going it! Hugh watched with
breathless interest. At the same time he saw the Englishman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
throw a similar sum on the black. The table was
covered with big notes and placques. Every one awaited
the turn of the cards with breathless interest.</p>

<p>“<i>Couleur perd.</i>”</p>

<p>The Twitcher had lost his twelve thousand francs. His
face grew very pale. Then he reached forward. Just
as the croupier was about to rake in his wad of bills he
grabbed them up again, and crammed them into his pocket.</p>

<p>“I made a mistake,” he announced calmly. “I meant
to play on black.”</p>

<p>“But Monsieur has lost....”</p>

<p>“I don’t care. I’ve got my money back. If you want
to get it, you will have to take it from me. But I warn
you I will make a desperate fight for it. It is all I have in
the world. If I lose it, I am ruined. I will then kill myself.
All I have, I have lost in this cursed den of thieves.
You won’t get this without a struggle. And again, I
warn you, I am armed.”</p>

<p>The crowd fell back, seemingly admiring his daring.
Two lackeys in blue and gold advanced threateningly, but
the Twitcher put his hand to his hip pocket in a significant
fashion.</p>

<p>“Look out,” he said quietly. “I am going away. If
any one lays a hand on me I will defend myself.”</p>

<p>Then with a leisurely gait and air of triumph he
walked out of the Casino.</p>

<p>The whole thing was over in a moment. The inspectors
came crowding round. The floor director, a bandy-legged,
pot-bellied man with a stubby grey beard, hurried up; he
was joined by another man with goggle eyes and a face
like a mulatto. They talked, gesticulated, shrugged their
shoulders. There was nothing to be done. A fracas on
the floor of the Casino, that was inconceivable! Legally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
they could not claim the money. It was a gambling debt.
Let it go!</p>

<p>So the storm subsided. The croupiers recovered from
their stupefaction. They raked in the other winnings and
paid the winners. Among the latter was the tall Englishman
who had played on black. He did not seem to understand
French. He kept saying: “Mo-ah! Mo-ah!”
and point to his stake. They paid him one by one twelve
crisp bills of one thousand francs each. He deliberately
folded up the notes and went away.</p>

<p>That evening Hugh returned from a walk by way of
Beausoleil. Outside of a café of the lower sort, he saw
two men smoking. In spite of the darkness, he recognized
the Twitcher and the tall Englishman. Hugh was
so curious, that he sat down and ordered something to
drink. He had not waited long when two men approached
from the other direction. They were Bob Bender and the
detective Krantz. Bob stepped before the drinking couple.</p>

<p>“Well, you brought it off,” he said in a not unfriendly
way.</p>

<p>The tall Englishman laughed. “Yes, damn you, we
got twelve thousand out of you.”</p>

<p>Krantz stepped forward. “Let me congratulate you,
gentlemen. It is not every one gets ahead of us so easily.
But we do not forget. I would strongly advise you to go
away immediately.” Again the Englishman laughed.</p>

<p>“Bah! What do we care for you now? We have
crossed the frontier. We are on French soil. We snap
our fingers at your little tin-pot Principality.”</p>

<p>Krantz smiled pleasantly. He spoke in his silky voice,
rubbing his hands together. Again Hugh noticed that the
little finger of the right was missing.</p>

<p>“We know all about you,” he purred. “We have your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
record in France, England, America. We don’t want you
here. You had better get out.”</p>

<p>“What if I refuse?”</p>

<p>“Refuse! Well....” Krantz rubbed his hands still
harder and continued in his cheerful, chirping way,
“Listen....” With his lips he blew a shrill, peculiar
whistle. From the shadow across the road half a dozen
dark shapes detached themselves.</p>

<p>“After all,” said Krantz, “the frontier is very near,
the other side of the street, to be precise. It would be
easy to take you over there by force. Once we have you,
... there’s no saying what might happen.”</p>

<p>The Englishman made a grimace. He seemed to reflect.
Finally he banged his hand on the table.</p>

<p>“You go to hell,” he said.</p>

<p>Krantz blandly said good-night, and taking Bob Bender
by the arm went quietly away. The mysterious shadows
across the street melted again into the deeper shadow.
But the Twitcher and the Englishman did not laugh any
more. Presently the Englishman rose.</p>

<p>“I expect he’s right. We’d better go.”</p>

<p>Hugh went thoughtfully homeward.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s one system,” he said to himself, “that will
take some beating.”</p>


<h4>5.</h4>

<p>In the weeks that followed he had no difficulty in making
his three louis a day, and in no case did he need to go
beyond the fourth term of his progression. It was sometimes
difficult to find the combination necessary for his
<i>coup</i>; but once he found it, he played with an almost
mechanical assurance and considered the louis of gain as
good as in his pocket. He had earned it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>His favourite among the rooms was the “Hall of the
Three Graces.” It was brilliant with many mirrors, and
the chandeliers were like cascades of light. The air was
better too. At the end table, sitting directly under the
Three Graces, Mr. MacTaggart played his system. His
grave air of a church elder seemed to be a standing reproach
to what he called, “Them shameless hussies above
ma heid.”</p>

<p>In the pauses between play, Hugh became familiar with
the strange characters of the place. He knew them by
their nicknames, and made sketches of them in his note-book.
He never wearied of watching these <i>détraqués</i> of
the game. He would sit for hours on one of the couches of
padded leather, forgetting to play in his absorbed interest.</p>

<p>Often after he had gained his “day,” he would escape
from the fetid air of the Rooms, from the sordid eyes
in the mean faces, from the monotony of excitement, and
seek a quiet corner of the Café de Paris. There he would
sit and smoke, pervaded by a sense of utter content: his
strenuous moment over. The Casino was paying for his
tea, his cakes. The Casino was his banker, his provider,
a charitable institution erected for his benefit. He looked
at it, so peaceful in the afternoon sunlight. No hint of the
scrabbling mob behind its biscuit-coloured walls.</p>

<p>Perhaps after all it was not so black as they painted it.
Perhaps it did not do all the harm they claimed. People
amused themselves, lost money they could afford to lose,
went away satisfied. No, it was a very charming institution
indeed. It was very good to him. It would give
him all the money he wanted. He was drunk with success.
He loved the place.</p>

<p>Then suddenly ... <i>woof!</i> his system went all to pieces.</p>

THE SMILES AND FROWNS OF FORTUNE</h3>
</div>

<h4>1.</h4>

<p class="drop-cap">“I &#160;SAY, Margot, I think I’ll go to the Casino to-night.”</p>

<p>The girl looked at him in surprise. It had been
his habit after supper to light his pipe and read
until bedtime, or else work at his eternal permanencies.
She had enjoyed these quiet evenings in the glow of the
shaded lamp, bending over a bit of embroidery, listening
to the puff of his pipe, and the rustle of his Daily Mail.</p>

<p>“I didn’t make the ‘necessary’ to-day,—only a couple
of louis. The Rooms were so squalid I got a beast of
a headache, and had to take a walk on the hill. I’ll get
that extra win this evening.”</p>

<p>“Oh, please don’t go. Something tells me if you do
you’ll be unlucky.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense. It’s not a question of luck. My system
is misfortune proof. Luck or no luck it will win. If you
are lonely, why don’t you go to the cinema, and amuse
yourself?”</p>

<p>But Margot did not want to go out, so with a last glance
at her sweet face under its coils of gold he left the
room.</p>

<p>“Good little sort,” he thought. “I’m really getting
very fond of her.”</p>

<p>As he emerged from the huddle of houses, a moon the
shape and colour of a musk melon was rising from the sea.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
The two cement arms of the harbour held in their closed
fists the harbour lights, one emerald, the other ruby.</p>

<p>“The green of hope,” he thought, “aye, and the crimson
of tragedy.” He walked slowly up the steep hill, reflecting
that three months ago he would have climbed it
only with an effort. How this place had bucked him up!
He must be careful though. Too much Casino, bad air,
excitement,—that was already affecting him. Witness his
splitting headache that afternoon. He doubted, though,
if he could stay away from it now. It certainly got
one,—roulette! The great wheel which symbolized all the
smaller wheels whirled you helplessly with it! It was
like an eddy in which the players were circling, getting
nearer and nearer the centre, until ... down to ruin.
Ah! the Wheel! the Wheel! In the evening he found the
Casino quite different from the rest of the day. The asthmatic
system-players of the morning were in their beds;
the cheap-trippers and skimmers of the afternoon had
returned to Nice; only four roulette tables were running
and the quietness was almost startling.</p>

<p>This was the time when the great hotels poured forth
their streams of wealth and fashion, the hour of the <i>élite</i>.
Seated on one of the yellow divans beside the money changing
booths, he watched the parade. The men wore dinner
jackets and their faces were flushed with wine. They had
been playing golf or tennis, or motoring in long, luxurious
cars; now armed with tickets for the private rooms they
came to cap the day with the excitement of losing a few
hundred louis. With sparkling eyes and a fluttering air
of excitement, their women followed them. Some of them
were half naked, like savages. Many had the arms of
washerwomen and the speckled shoulders of kitchen maids.
Others were skraggy, with flat greenish busts and stringy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
necks. Each sought to outvie the other in the gorgeousness
of her raiment. There were robes of shimmering
beads, robes of rich brocade, robes of delicate lace, robes
of exquisite embroidery, robes trimmed with gold, and
robes hung with lustrous sequins. There were old ugly
women in lovely dresses, worthless women with small fortunes
on their backs. This luxury and extravagance had
something barbaric about it. Hugh had never seen anything
like it before. It seemed as if these people had
dressed up purposely to amuse him.</p>

<p>“Who toils to keep it up?” he wondered. “What suffering
and sacrifice lies behind it? It’s enough to make a
chap turn socialist.”</p>

<p>After a while he rose. A number of women with elaborately
painted faces were going from table to table,
pretending to watch the game, but turning to gaze at
some man player with a peculiar little smile. If he took
no notice they would sidle off again.</p>

<p>Hugh saw many people he knew, among them Mrs. and
Miss Calderbrook. The Calderbrook family seemed to live
in the Rooms now. This evening Mr. Calderbrook was
not with them, and they were taking advantage of his
absence to play with louis instead of five franc pieces.
When Hugh saw them lose five louis, he shook his head
in mock warning, but they were too engrossed to notice
him. Their faces were flushed, their eyes excited. He
saw Mrs. Calderbrook take a bill of five hundred francs
from her purse and change it into red chips. He was wondering
if she was going to risk it all at one time, when his
attention was distracted; his own moment to play had
come.</p>

<p>The even numbers had been up eight times running;
then there had been a break to the odd; then another even.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
This was his chance. He put a louis on the odd. He lost.
He put another louis on the odd. Again he lost. This
time he was rather pleased, for it was his buffer stake,
and if he had won he would have been where he started.
He settled down to his defence. He put three louis on
the odd. A loss. He increased it to six. Again a loss.
It was beginning to be interesting. Only once before had
he gotten so far in his progression. Still with calm assurance
he put twelve louis on the odd. Curiously enough
the number twelve came up. Lost! Then quite suddenly
all his confidence deserted him. He began to get frightened.
He fumbled in his pockets. The next stake was
to be twenty-five louis. Quick! the ball was already spinning.
He handed a note for five hundred francs to the
croupier.</p>

<p>“Impair....”</p>

<p>Then he heard the monotonous cry of the spinner:
“<i>Numero deux, pair, noir et manque.</i>”</p>

<p>It was incredible, a conspiracy against him. It seemed
as if the odd numbers had ceased to exist. He was down
to his last stake, fifty-two louis. As he threw it on the
table a strange recklessness surged up in him, the irresponsibility
that takes hold of the gambler and makes
him risk his last dollar on the spin. He had a miserable
moment of suspense, then with a nonchalant air the spinner
twitched away the ball. <i>Number twenty</i>....</p>

<p>He had lost everything. He was dazed. The great
Hall of Light seemed to be full of dark shadows, and
the faces of those around him touched with mockery. He
was turning to go when a hand gripped his arm. He beheld
at his elbow the contumelious countenance of Mr.
Gimp.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>“How much d’ye want?” snapped the little man, opening
a large pocket-book.</p>

<p>“Nothing. I’ve lost everything. Broke! Couldn’t
pay you if I borrowed.”</p>

<p>“How much d’ye <i>want</i>?”</p>

<p>Hugh scarcely knew what he was saying. “I’ve lost
two thousand. I’d probably win it back this time if I
could go on. It can’t always keep coming even.”</p>

<p>“Here, take this two thousand.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to.”</p>

<p>“Take it, I say.”</p>

<p>Hugh took the notes and threw them on the impair just
as the ball was slackening its spin. “<i>Numero treize, noir,
impair et manque.</i>”</p>

<p>He had won at last. He took from the table the four
thousand francs, and returned Mr. Gimp his two bills, saying:</p>

<p>“You shouldn’t have done that.”</p>

<p>“I know I shouldn’t.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know how to thank you. You saved me.
But there.... Bang goes my system.”</p>

<p>“Mighty good job, too. Your system was no use. You
were playing against a phenomenon. Don’t you see the
phenomenon was lying in wait for you, and sooner or later
you were going to go up against it. Bah! this rotten
place. Let’s go into the atrium and have a smoke. When
I see these fools all crazy over that rotten wheel I am
ashamed of the human race.”</p>

<p>Sitting on her usual seat near the door was the Emslie
girl; she seemed very tired and started up every time any
one came out.</p>

<p>“There!” said Mr. Gimp fiercely, “just look at that kid.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
Should be in her bed hours ago. Waiting for her fool
of a mother who is playing like the devil in the <i>salon privé</i>.
If you were to open that woman’s head you’d find a roulette
wheel instead of a brain.”</p>

<p>As Hugh left the Casino the night air seemed delicious.
The moon was now perfect in shape,—a moon worthy
even of Monte Carlo, dappling the oily swell of the harbour
with pools of playful quicksilver. He sat on a bench and
watched it till his serenity returned.</p>

<p>When at last he entered their room, the lamp was
turned very low and behind the grey curtain that divided
them he heard the girl breathing gently.</p>


<h4>2.</h4>

<p>After breakfast next morning, Hugh sat figuring
over his green book of permanencies. Finally he
said:</p>

<p>“See here, Margot, I think I’ll have to change my system.”</p>

<p>“Why, what’s the matter with it?”</p>

<p>“Well ... you see I have to walk about so much between
the tables. It tires me out.”</p>

<p>“I thought you didn’t like to ‘win too easily’?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t mind not winning easily.”</p>

<p>“Ah! you’ve been losing.”</p>

<p>“No, I haven’t. My capital’s intact and I have five
hundred francs of gain. But ... well, I’m tired of it.
I want a change.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to try now?”</p>

<p>“I call it a pattern system. You see I set the bank a
task....”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>“I <i>don’t</i> see.”</p>

<p>“Look here then. Look at this diagram.”</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_165.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>“These figures represent the dozens arranged in three
columns. They form a certain pattern, a pattern of
seven. Now I sit comfortably at a table (no more walking
for me), and take down numbers, arranging both the
dozens and columns in three rows. When my figures
begin to accumulate, I look back to see if I cannot find
a coincidence between the pattern I am making, and the
one that has gone before. When I find this, and the pattern
duplicates as far as the sixth figure I simply bet
that it won’t go as far as the seventh. That is to say,
suppose I get a second set of figures similar to those I
have set down here as far as the sixth, I simply bet against
the repetition of the last. Am I clear?”</p>

<p>“Not very,—but I understand.”</p>

<p>“What do you think of it?”</p>

<p>“Fantastic.”</p>

<p>“Not at all. I am defying the bank to repeat the same
combination of dozens or columns in a comparatively
short space of time. The odds are overwhelmingly in my
favour. You see in this game one has certain advantages
over the bank. One can choose one’s moment to enter,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
and one can retire when one wants. Also one can make a
progression.”</p>

<p>“Are you making one?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I begin by putting a hundred francs between the
two dozens on which I am betting. If that should fail,
I will increase to three hundred francs, and then if necessary
to a thousand. In the first two cases I win fifty
francs, in the third a hundred. I would always bet, of
course, against the corresponding dozen or column of
the combination I am following. In short, to finally beat
me the bank needs to produce a coincidence of nine. That,
you must admit, is extraordinary.”</p>

<p>“It is a game of the devil. Anything may happen.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m going to get four wins a day. That will
mean two hundred francs. At that rate in about ten
days I will have your two thousand francs, and you can
go back to Paris and start your little shop.”</p>

<p>“You seem in a hurry to get rid of me.”</p>

<p>“No, it’s not that.... But you know we can’t go on
like this indefinitely. It would look queer. I have to
think of your reputation.”</p>

<p>“Don’t bother about my reputation. As for your own,
and the opinion of your friends ... well, I am very discreet,
am I not? We never go out together.”</p>

<p>“No, no one need ever know. And after all we have
nothing to reproach ourselves with. We’re playing the
game like two good pals. Our consciences are clear.”</p>

<p>He let the matter drop there; but the question of Margot’s
future worried him. He knew he would always be
interested in her, and that it would hurt him if any ill befell her;
he was beginning to think of her as if she were
really his sister.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span></p>


<h4>3.</h4>

<p>Hugh found his new system absorbing, but very fatiguing.
Looking back through rows of figures for coinciding
groups was something of a mental strain. When, however,
his opportunity came to play, he did so with calm certitude.
In no instance was he beaten. It seemed as if the
powers of correspondence exhausted themselves after the
sixth term.</p>

<p>Sitting snugly at one of the tables with pencil and note-book,
he would lose all sense of his surroundings. He was
alone with the wheel; the rest was a dream. Vaguely he
was aware of players reaching over his shoulders, and of
the monotonous voices of bored croupiers. Sometimes a
dispute would arouse him from his distraction and amuse
him a little; but though he often could have settled it, he
never “butted in.” It was none of his business. Also he
never handed any one their winnings. The one time when
he had done so he had handed to the wrong person. Fortunately
it had been only a question of ten francs and the
bank had promptly paid a second time. After that, however,
when people asked him to pass money he gave them
a rake and let them get it for themselves.</p>

<p>During the long hours at the table Hugh entered into
conversation with his various neighbours, and made many
of these gambling acquaintances so easily made, so easily
unmade. Roulette is a destroyer of reserve; its courtesies
mean nothing, and people who chat at the table, when they
meet afterwards on the terrace, stare frigidly.</p>

<p>Of these acquaintances the only one with whom he became
in any way friendly was a one-legged Irishman with
red hair, Major Fitzoswald. He played a dashing game,
always building around the number thirty-two. When<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
he won he won heavily; but more often he lost. He had
a jolly little wife and four children, ranging from a baby
to a girl of seven; and when he had finished gambling in
the afternoon, he would hobble out of the Casino on his
crutches and join them in the sand pit near the dove-cot.
It was said that he had lost his leg in a glorious action
on the Somme front.</p>

<p>One day Hugh was amazed to see Mr. Gimp actually
playing. The little man was standing erect and business-like
at the <i>trente-et-quarante</i> table opposite the American
millionairess. She had a tiny mannikin in front of
her as a mascot. On one finger was an immense diamond,
and around her neck glimmered a double string of superb
pearls. Her blonde beauty suggested pearls; and her wide-set
blue eyes, mobile mouth and very strong white teeth
made her look like a happy child. Every time she played
Mr. Gimp would play on the opposite chance. But while
the honey-coloured beauty threw on heaps of placques,
now rising to rose, now dropping to azure, Mr. Gimp
played only a modest louis. Behind his hand he whispered
to Hugh:</p>

<p>“This is the best system of all. It’s known as ‘playing
the corpse.’ You get opposite a big player and play the
contrary. When they have to make a progression, you
win on all its terms. It goes without saying they’re dead
ones from the start. The Casino will get their money.
You’re playing on the side of the Casino, that’s all. And
while the Casino is taking big risks, you are taking small
ones. ‘Playing the corpse,’—it’s the only sure system I
know. It’s a shame to take the money. You know I hate
gambling like hell; but if there’s easy money lying round
a man’s a damn fool if he don’t pick it up.”</p>

<p>When Hugh returned late in the afternoon the beautiful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
American was still playing, and opposite her, methodically
putting on his single louis, was the pertinacious Mr.
Gimp.</p>


<h4>4.</h4>

<p>One day Hugh arrived home for luncheon looking exultantly
happy. The table was neatly set, and the girl
was in the little cabinet where she cooked.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! Margot. I’ve got something for you.”</p>

<p>“I can’t come for a minute. I’m cooking two soles I
bought in the market. I saw you coming, so I put them
on.”</p>

<p>“All right. How jolly the place looks. How nice you
keep everything. We’ll both be sorry to leave it.”</p>

<p>The girl turned suddenly. Her voice trembled.</p>

<p>“Leave it! Why?”</p>

<p>“Hang it, one can’t stay here always. I’m feeling
stronger than ever I did in my life. I want to get out
and do things. And you?”</p>

<p>“I’ve never been so happy as I’ve been here.”</p>

<p>“I really believe I can say the same. It’s been awfully
jolly. What a pity all pleasant things must end! We
both have the future to face. But I’ll take care you have
your share of happiness. That’s why I’m giving you
this....”</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“Look out. The fish is burning. Finish frying and
you’ll see.”</p>

<p>He threw an envelope on her plate, and she went back
to the little gas-stove. He watched her with pleasure.
She was so slim and trim in her pink apron, with her hair
massed in shining coils round her head. She had so much
of it that she scarcely knew what to do with it. He liked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
her eyes, too. They were a brave, sympathetic blue. Her
face was English in its open frankness. It was wonderful
how she had changed. A softness had replaced her sharp
lines and the hollows had become curves. Her mouth
had lost its hopeless look, and was now tenderly sweet....
He almost regretted what he was going to do. Well,
she would always be his little sister; he would never lose
sight of her.</p>

<p>She brought the fish and potatoes, and sat down. As
she took up the envelope he watched her eagerly. She
opened it and drew out two crisp bills for a thousand
francs each. Her face grew pale.</p>

<p>“What’s this?” she faltered.</p>

<p>“It’s yours,” he exulted. “I had a splendid morning.
Got two hundred francs ever so easily. Now that I’ve
made up the sum you need, you can start for Paris to-morrow
if you like.”</p>

<p>She pushed the money away from her.</p>

<p>“I don’t want it. It’s yours. I can’t take it.”</p>

<p>“What? Why, I won it for you! It was for you I
gambled; for you I risked my capital. It’s given me the
rarest pleasure doing this for you; now you mustn’t spoil
all by refusing.”</p>

<p>“But I do refuse,” she cried fiercely. “It’s your money.
How can I take it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, rot! You’ll make me cross in a minute. Granted
it was an absurd idea on my part to make the Casino pay
you back this money, what else was there to do? I
couldn’t leave you in the hole. I had to do something
for you. This way appealed to me as being both original
and amusing. Come now ... if you like, consider it a
loan, you can pay me back some day. There! It’s the
solution of all your difficulties. It will establish you,—perhaps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
be the beginning of a modest fortune. Think
of that bright little bonnet-shop on the Boulevard du
Montparnasse. How happy you’ll be there. And I’ll
come and see you....”</p>

<p>“If I take it as a loan, will you stop gambling?”</p>

<p>“Oh, come now, that’s absurd. Why should I? It
really amuses me very much and I’m sure to win. The
Casino owes me a living. It’s like a bank from which
I draw a little every day. It would be a shame to stop.”</p>

<p>“You’re like all the rest. I’ve seen it coming over you
for some time. You’re getting to think of nothing but
roulette. You used to go for long walks, spend your time
in the open air; now you’re either in the Rooms or working
over permanencies. In the end you’ll lose everything.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense. I tell you I understand the game now. I
can get my living at it. It only needs prudence, patience,
judgment. A man can start with five francs and win a
fortune. The great mass of the people are fools. They
play anyhow. But I tell you it takes brains to play that
game. There are the laws of chance, the calculation of
probabilities.... Oh, I know I can win. I tell you, I
can win....”</p>

<p>“I’ve heard the others say that,” she answered scornfully.
“Once I thought the same. It’s all an illusion. In
the end it’s ruin.”</p>

<p>“All right. You won’t take that money?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>He was angry. He wanted to shake her. The air was
charged with hostility. “I’m sorry,” he said. “You’ve
made me feel like a fool.” Rising he left the house. The
two little crisp soles remained untasted on their plates.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER FOUR<br />


SHIFTS AND STRESSES</h3>
</div>

<h4>1.</h4>

<p class="drop-cap">IN his irritation and perplexity, he went for a long walk
by the shore.</p>

<p>“Confound the girl!” he thought. “What right
has she to be so proud! Pride is for those who can afford
it. There she was, sick, desperate, without one <i>sou</i>. I
saved her from goodness knows what. And now, behold!
When she ought to be humble, she throws up her head,
turns independent, refuses my further help....”</p>

<p>With his stick he switched savagely at a clump of
geraniums that stained a villa wall.</p>

<p>“Confounded fool that I was ever to have anything to
do with her. These sudden quixotic impulses! They always
lead to trouble. Damn! It was none of my business.
Who could have blamed me if I had let her go her own
way? And yet ... that would have worried me enormously.
Her own way! What would it have been? I’d
hate to think of any harm coming to her. No, I feel I am
bound to protect her....”</p>

<p>He sat down and stared at the sea. He watched the
same wave washing the same rock it had washed for centuries.
Its monotonous persistency soothed his spirit.</p>

<p>“After all, she’s a jolly, good little sort. She’s made
me feel a fool, though. She knew all along I was only
gambling for her sake. She might have let me know she
wouldn’t take the money. Maybe the whole idea was
silly, sentimental.... No, it wasn’t. It was a good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
sporting proposition. Any other chap would have done
it. Besides, it amused me. I got all the reward I wanted
in the fun of winning. I made gambling a virtue instead
of a vice. I played the knight-errant fighting for the fair
lady with chips for a weapon and a roulette table for the
field of battle.”</p>

<p>He felt better. He rose and began to flip flat stones
over the water.</p>

<p>“She’s got to take the money. It’s hers. I don’t want
it. Why won’t she take it? If she had been a princess
instead of a poor working girl I could have understood.
I don’t mind if she regards it as a loan. There’s no harm
in that. An honest loan. Haven’t I been decent and
honourable? Haven’t I treated her with every respect?
Haven’t I been like a brother to her? Why can’t she
accept my aid? Ridiculous, I call it. Girls are funny.
Hanged if a chap can understand them....” Having
had enough of stone flipping, he lit a cigarette and resumed
his seat on the rock.</p>

<p>“Well, what’s to be done? The present state of affairs
can’t go on forever. I rather wish it could, though—it’s
been so nice having her there. She’s made the place
so homey, looked after me so well. Don’t think I’ve ever
been so happy. But there! It would be dangerous to go
further. We have each our own way to make in the
world, and our ways don’t lie together. If she won’t
take the money I must do something else to help her. I
have to go on helping her. Poor kid! She’s had a devil
of a time up to now. I’m sorry if I have hurt her feelings....
I’ll go home and make it up.”</p>

<p>But instead of going home he found himself drawn irresistibly
to that great “centre of depravity” (as Mr.
Gimp called it), the Casino. He was leaning moodily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
against one of the columns of the atrium when the doors
leading to the Opera House belched forth a weird crowd
of Monegasques.</p>

<p>The opera is one of Monte Carlo’s delusions, for though
it is widely advertised as one of the attractions of the
place, a large proportion of the seats are given away to
the natives, those descendants of Sæacen pirates who now
plunder the visitor by modern methods. It is as if the
company that exploits the Principality, having planted the
Casino in their midst and forbidden them to enter the
gambling rooms, was trying to make up to them in other
ways. The same seats are filled night after night by
swarthy folk, barbarously bedecked in flaunting finery.
The laundress or lodging-house keeper of the Condamine
smirks across the stalls at the butcher or the baker of the
upper town, who, in turn, bows deeply to the bureaucrat
who lives on the Rock, and is wondering if his dress shirt
will last the season without another washing.</p>

<p>As Hugh watched the crowd he heard a voice suddenly
address him:</p>

<p>“You’re not going into that monkey-show, are you?”</p>

<p>Looking round he saw Mrs. Belmire seated near him,
holding an unlighted cigarette. She wore a gorgeous
gown of egg-yolk yellow and pea-pod green. Under a
modified Gainsborough hat, her mahogany-tinted hair
rippled over her shell-pink ears.</p>

<p>“Give me a light, please! I’m dying for a smoke. Just
been in the Rooms and lost fifty louis. Isn’t it silly of me?
I’ve seen you playing quite a lot lately. Have you been
lucky?”</p>

<p>Hugh was discreet. “No, not very. I play a small
game. Just for chicken-feed.”</p>

<p>“Well, as long as you don’t lose, you’re lucky enough.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
I say, you can take me for tea to the Café de Paris, if
you like.”</p>

<p>Hugh was flattered. They found a place in the restaurant
from which they could watch the dancing. Mrs.
Belmire looked rather stunning, and he was proud of being
her escort. They listened to the confident music, ate
chocolate cake and drank insipid tea.</p>

<p>“I bought two new hats to-day,” said Mrs. Belmire.
“They cost a lot of money. I’m sure when I get them
home I’ll hate them. I always like to have a pal with
me, when I chose a new hat. I wish <i>you’d</i> been with me to
help me choose.”</p>

<p>Hugh expressed a polite regret, with an uneasy feeling
that his privilege in such an event might not be confined
to choosing. Mrs. Belmire went on to talk about herself
with an engaging frankness and almost childlike egoism.
She elaborately displayed the confidence that is supposed
to engender confidence; but Hugh was cautious.</p>

<p>“I suppose you’re going to the automobile show to-morrow,”
she said. “You’re crazy about cars, aren’t
you? I am. When my husband was alive, I used to drive
our car myself. I drive a good deal here. My men friends
are very nice to me, and take me for such jolly spins.
You must take me some afternoon. By the way, where do
you hang out now?”</p>

<p>“I’m living in the Condamine,” said Hugh vaguely.</p>

<p>“Are you? You’re lucky. I have had to give up my
apartment. Lost so much playing at the club that I had
to draw in my horns. I’m now staying at an Italian
pension on the sea front,—Pizzicato’s. It’s very nice. The
cooking’s Italian. To-day we had eels for lunch; I didn’t
know they were eels till I had finished, or else I don’t believe
I should have enjoyed them so much. You must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
lunch with me some day. I had General Jenkinson yesterday.
You don’t know him, do you?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t think I do,” said Hugh with a doubtful
inflection.</p>

<p>“Delightful man. Oh, I say, my friend who looks so
like you, Paul Vulning, is on his way here. You’ll probably
meet him.”</p>

<p>All the time she talked—and it was principally of herself—Hugh
could see that she was trying to find out
more about him. For his part it pleased him to baffle her.
Her manner was breezy, her voice ringing; he liked her,
and judging by the smiling regard in her nut-brown
eyes she liked him. It was nearly seven o’clock when she
said: “There now, you’ve been awfully decent to me. Perhaps,
you wouldn’t mind driving me to my hotel.”</p>

<p>Hugh called a voiture and accompanied her to the
Pension Pizzicato. At the door she held his hand.</p>

<p>“I say, if you aren’t very comfortable where you’re
staying, why not come here? I wish you would. There’s
such a nice room next mine, and not too dear. Do say
you’ll take it.”</p>

<p>Hugh hesitated. “I’ll think over it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, do. And I say,—won’t you lunch with me to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I can’t. I’ve got a friend coming to see
me.”</p>

<p>“Bring your friend, too. Tell him you know a very
jolly Englishwoman you would like him to meet.”</p>

<p>“I’ll see. I’ll ask my friend.”</p>

<p>She shook his hand warmly. So as not to look cheap
he took the voiture back. It cost him twenty francs,
which with the thirty francs for tea made fifty.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>“A charming woman,” he thought, “but expensive,—damned
expensive. I mustn’t cultivate her.”</p>


<h4>2.</h4>

<p>He had dinner at Quinto’s Restaurant. He knew that
Margot would be waiting for him at home, but his meeting
with Mrs. Belmire had made him a little arrogant. He
resolved to give the girl a lesson.</p>

<p>“Let her worry,” he said to himself; “it will do her
good.”</p>

<p>After dinner he had intended to take a walk, but the
Casino drew him like a magnet. Good old Casino! So
friendly, so inviting, so generous. Down the long, pansy-patterned
sward of the garden, between the proud palms
he could see its portico, goldenly aglow. The big yellow
hotel-bus from Cap D’Ail dashed up to the door, small
figures in evening dress got out and mounted the seven
carpeted steps. He was conscious suddenly that he, too,
wanted to play. Yes, more than anything in the world
he wanted to gamble.</p>

<p>More brilliant than ever seemed the “Hall of Light.”
Nearly all the men were in evening dress. Perhaps it was
the influence of Mrs. Belmire, but for the first time Hugh
felt out of place in his serge suit.</p>

<p>“I must get a dinner jacket,” he thought, “and all that
goes with it.” Then came a second thought: “Why not
make the bank buy me one? If I can win a thousand
francs! By Gad! I’ll try it.”</p>

<p>He had his capital, two thousand francs, in his pocket.
He felt strangely elated. Perhaps it was the flush of his
recent success, perhaps the flask of Chianti he had taken
with his dinner. He changed a note of five hundred francs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
into the red counters that represent louis, and began to
play a game between two tables. He bet that one table
would not repeat the colour that had just come up on
the other. When he lost he made a progression. It was
lively and exciting, and after playing an hour he found
his twenty-five louis had increased by ten.</p>

<p>Two hundred francs for his dress suit in sixty minutes,—that
wasn’t bad. Now with his winnings he could afford
to be a little reckless; so as the impair at one table had
come up seven times running, he played pair with a hundred
francs,—and lost. Cheerfully he put another hundred
on pair for the next spin: he lost. Too bad! All his
winnings gone. He felt nettled. He would get them back
quickly enough. He would go on backing pair for the
break in the run. He put on a hundred: impair. He
doubled: again impair. He martingaled to four hundred:
alas! still impair.</p>

<p>His feeling of resentment had now given way to one
of alarm. He had lost seven hundred. Then just as the
ball was thrown, moved by a sudden desperate impulse,
he tossed the rest of his capital, thirteen hundred francs,
on the table. There ... if he won, he would gain six
hundred francs; if he lost, he would have—the emotion.
He felt his heart beating thickly. He saw a woman close
by turn and look at him curiously. He contrived a careless
smile. Then, inexorable as fate, he heard the colourless
voice of the croupier: <i>Thirteen.</i> Impair again; he had
lost.</p>

<p>He stood looking stupidly at his little pile of money,
his no longer. As if to torment him the croupier raked
it in with what seemed an unnecessary show of indifference.
It had happened all so quickly. He was stunned,
sick. He looked round, but there was no Mr. Gimp to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
save him this time. He felt at that moment he would
have traded his soul for money to go on. A run of fourteen
on impair,—it was incredible.</p>

<p>The woman who had glanced at him was a little old
Jewess known as the “Swallow.” She was dressed in rusty
fragments of black crepe, held together by a host of
safety pins. She had a bit of pale blue silk wound in a
weird fashion about her throat, and another bit of the
same in her musty black bonnet. On her hands she had
black lace mittens over rusty black gloves, from the fingers
of which her nails emerged. Her face, covered with a
white veil and a thick coating of bluish-white powder, was
precisely like the waxen face of a corpse.</p>

<p>As his stake was swept away, Hugh saw this ghoulish
creature begin to play on the pair and win time after time.
She was taking advantage of his bad luck. Pair came
six times running. He went into the refreshment room
and ordered a brandy and soda.</p>

<p>While he was drinking it, the old Jewess waddled in.
The black tail of her dress, which gave her her name, wiggled
after her. She ordered coffee, then fumbling in a
mildewed looking bag, took from it the black stump of a
cigar and lit it carefully. She sat puffing her cigar, and
watching Hugh, the black eyes in her corpse-like face
snapping with pure malice. He gulped down the rest of
his brandy and went out quickly. He hated the place,
loathed it.</p>

<p>As he descended the long, sloping road to the Condamine,
the lights seemed to glitter in cruel mockery. The
harbour lamps turned to green and red serpents wriggling
on the varnished blackness of the water; the lamps of the
quay thrust downward silver octopus-arms. Everything
was reptilian, abhorrent. He was ruined.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>Softly he crept up to the familiar room. The lamp
was turned low and a simple supper set for him. In
every corner he could see some evidence of Margot’s neatness
and care. She was sleeping; he heard her steady
breathing from behind the curtain. For the first time
he pulled it aside a little, and peered in. Her hair was a
bright disorder on the pillow. She had been crying a
good deal for her eyes were red and swollen. He would
have liked to waken her, to beg her forgiveness. As he
turned away he saw on the table where he had left it, the
envelope containing the two thousand francs.</p>

<p>The sight hardened him. She was still too proud to
take it. He, too, could be proud. If it came to a contest
of wills, he would prove himself the stronger. He
sat down, sullen, bitter, brooding. Then temptation came
to him. He looked at the money lying in the envelope.
It was hers, absolutely hers but ... why not borrow it,
play with it, win back what he had lost? He felt sure he
could win this time,—sure.</p>

<p>Bah! what a demoralizing business gambling was! Here
he was throwing all his pride to the winds, wanting to
sneak away with this money that was to establish her in
business, to risk it on the tables. How ashamed he would
be if she knew! But she need not know. He could return
it in an hour’s time. After all, in a sense, was it not his?
Had he not a right to borrow it? He took it up, then
laid it down again.</p>

<p>“No, damn it! It’s not playing the game.”</p>

<p>Then after another spell of morose musing, his hand
went out to it once more.</p>

<p>“Well, there’s no use leaving it there. I might as well
put it in my pocket.”</p>

<p>He did so, and then continued to sit moodily staring at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
the lamp. He began to fidget restlessly. Finally he said:</p>

<p>“I don’t feel a bit sleepy. I’ll just go back to the
Casino and watch awhile.”</p>

<p>Already, having money in his pocket, he began to feel
better. As he climbed the long hill, he knew quite well
what he was going to do. Even as he entered the “Hall
of Light” he was thinking:</p>

<p>“The pair played me a scurvy trick to-night. It owes
me a good turn now.”</p>

<p>Going to the same table he laid a thousand francs on
pair. He lost.... He was becoming callous. These
flimsy bits of paper no longer represented real money.
He threw the second of them on pair. If he lost, what
matter! He would then be finished, purged clean, cured
of gambling forever. A good job too. Let him lose....
He won. He saw them lay a thousand franc
counter beside his bill. He looked at the two contemptuously.
With a nod to the croupier he left them there for
the next spin. He even strolled away a little and watched
the play at the neighbouring table. A curious and thrilling
sensation this,—to know that your fate is being decided
behind your back. Looking round, as if casually,
he saw that the ball had dropped and that they were not
raking in his money. Then he saw them add to it two
other counters of a thousand each. With a hand that
trembled a little he took up four thousand francs and
went home.</p>

<p>The lights were joyous again, the place adorable. So
he thought, as he hurried to their quiet room. Softly he
replaced the two thousand francs in the envelope. He
listened again to her breathing. Once more he peeped
through the curtain. Her face was like that of a tired,
fevered child. He felt a curious surge of affection for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
her, a warmth that was nigh to tenderness. With a
happy sense of her nearness, he sought his own bed and
immediately fell asleep.</p>


<h4>3.</h4>

<p>On rising next morning, he found she had set the table
for breakfast, but the envelope was gone.</p>

<p>“I’m going away,” she told him. “I’ll do anything you
ask. I don’t want to be a bother to you.”</p>

<p>“Don’t think I want to be rid of you. Still you must
see that, all things considered, it will really be for the
best.”</p>

<p>She was pale, but seemed cheerful and resigned. All
day she went about making her preparations for departure.</p>

<p>“I’ll take the train for Paris to-morrow,” she announced.</p>

<p>He was unprepared for the suddenness of her going.</p>

<p>“Oh, not to-morrow,” he said; “wait till the day after.
We’ll spend to-morrow together, go picnicking.”</p>

<p>She agreed and they took the train next morning
to La Turbie. They made a fire among the rocks and ate
a cold paté, cheese and fruit, as happy as two children.
Hugh went to get some water to make tea. When he
returned, he found the girl cowering at the foot of a big
rock. She had slipped and fallen, while gathering flowers.
The distance was about ten feet. She was all right, she
assured him, excepting her foot which hurt her badly.
She could not walk, so he had to lift her and carry her to
the road. He was greatly distressed. At the village he
got a <i>voiture</i> and they returned slowly to Monte Carlo.</p>

<p>He summoned a doctor who said that she had sprained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
her ankle badly and must rest for a week or two without
putting her foot to the ground.</p>

<p>“That’s very awkward,” she told the doctor. “I intended
going to Paris to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Impossible, madame,” he said; Hugh also echoed the
word, “Impossible.” She submitted to this decision with
a resignation that was almost too cheerful. Hugh was
sympathetic gentleness itself. He did the marketing with
the joyousness of a boy, and even attempted to cook under
her direction. Whenever he found himself free, he hastened
to the Casino to gamble; roulette was rapidly becoming
an obsession with him.</p>

<p>Propped with pillows in the big wicker arm-chair he had
bought her, Margot would sit and watch him. How his
teeth gleamed when he laughed. She loved the look of him,
tall, slim, with his fair hair brushed smoothly back, his
fine sensitive face, his eloquent dark eyes. He made a
graceful picture even when swathed in a white apron and
frying eggs.</p>

<p>“He is so good, so kind, so patient,” she sighed. “My
conscience hurts me. Oh, if he only knew I slipped from
that rock on purpose.”</p>

THE GAMBLER’S PROGRESS</h3>
</div>

<h4>1.</h4>

<p class="drop-cap">IN two weeks Margot was able to limp about; and, as
nothing more was said about her departure, she
quietly reassumed her household duties. Hugh was
happy. He was free to gamble. Morning, afternoon and
evening he was at the Casino. He invented fantastic systems
and enthusiastically tried them out, or like a hawk
hovered over a table watching for a likely chance. A
picker-up of unconsidered trifles, he called himself. He
was patient, prudent, intelligent. He believed in the calculation
of chances; and, best of all, he had an intuition
that was reasonably reliable. He loved the game, but
most of all he loved to turn out his pockets in the morning,
and to hand Margot a fistful of money with the remark:
“There! that’s for the house. By Gad! it’s a
great thing to live on the fat of the land at the cost of
the Casino.”</p>

<p>One day while doing her marketing the girl was stopped
by a tall dark man. She stared a moment. She could
scarcely believe her eyes: Florent Garnier. How changed!
He was stout, prosperous-looking, even pompous. He
had a fancy waistcoat, with a heavy gold chain, a broad-brimmed
Borsolino, and a diamond pin sparkling in a
rather loud tie. Yes, he was a big, handsome, important-looking
man.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>“Ha! ha! You are surprised, my little Margot,” he
laughed. “I’m altered, am I not? When you saw me last,
I was the lean Parisian workman. You remember I was
thrown into prison. That rascal Popol,—he croaked in
Laboisiniere. Black smallpox. Good job! I’d have
killed him when I got out. Well, soon after that, my uncle,
a big contractor in Lyons, died leaving me everything.
I’m a rich man now.”</p>

<p>“Then you’re not a socialist any more?”</p>

<p>“<i>Bon sang!</i> No! How can I be? I’m a <i>patron</i>.
Socialists don’t believe in <i>patrons</i>. No one remains a
socialist after he has acquired a little property. It
changes one’s ideas entirely. Socialism is for those who
have nothing and don’t see any prospect of having anything,
except by grabbing from those who have. We’re
all on the grab, the Socialist as much as every one else.
Oh, I know them. The leaders are exploiters of the proletariat.
Socialism is only a stepping stone to political
power.”</p>

<p>They were in the market place, close by the rock of
Monaco. Margot had a <i>filet</i> of vegetables on her arm,
a shawl on her head. As he talked Florent gesticulated,
a big diamond ring flashing on his brown hand.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he went on, “socialism is based on a wrong conception
of human nature. It believes that if you scratch
the man, you find the saint; whereas what you really find
is the savage. Human nature is selfish and nothing will
ever change it. Socialism believes in the unselfishness of
human nature. That’s its fundamental error. Then
again, it’s contrary to justice. It believes in paying all
workers equally. The good worker is to receive the same
wage as the poor. That is unjust. Yet the moment you
begin paying one man more than another you institute<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
capitalism.... But there! Come, let us sit at that
café under the arches and talk of yourself. What are
you doing? Not married, I hope.”</p>

<p>“No, I’m housekeeper to an English gentleman.”</p>

<p>“Ah! I’m not married either. Not for want of chances
though. Somehow there’s no one I fancy. Listen, Margot,—let’s
go to Nice this afternoon, if you can get away
from your place. Say it’s your cousin. Do come. We’ll
have a good time.”</p>

<p>After supper that night as Hugh sat pouring over his
permanencies, the girl looked up from her sewing.</p>

<p>“You will be surprised to hear I had an offer of
marriage this afternoon.”</p>

<p>He gazed at her abstractedly. “No, I’m not surprised.
You’re really awfully sweet, you know. I expect you’ve
had many. Well, I hope he’s a fine chap.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he is. He has a big business and makes lots of
money.”</p>

<p>“Good. That’s the great thing,—money! You know,
I think this system I’m working on will make lots of
money. Already it’s made a fortune on paper. Well,
when’s it coming off?”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“The marriage, of course.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve not accepted him. I don’t want to marry.
I’m too happy as I am.”</p>

<p>“What! Refuse such a good offer! Are you crazy?”</p>

<p>“Maybe. You see I’m foolish enough to think that one
should love the man one marries, and I don’t love this
one.”</p>

<p>“I accept the rebuke. Well, my dear girl, don’t make
any mistake. At the same time I’d be sorry to lose you
just yet. We seem to rub along so nicely together.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>“Do we? Then you don’t want me to marry?”</p>

<p>“Why, certainly. If you find the right man. My dear
child, your happiness will always be my first consideration.”</p>

<p>“Do you still want me to go back to Paris?”</p>

<p>“Please yourself about that. I must admit I’m beginning
to get so used to you I’d miss you awfully.”</p>

<p>With that he took his hat and went off to the Casino.
She was used to his brusque ways, but she looked after him
rather anxiously. He seemed to think of nothing now but
his hateful roulette. At meal-time he ate abstractedly and
over his cigarette he stared thoughtfully at columns of
figures. He took little notice of her. She was jealous;
jealous of a game of chance, jealous of the wheel.</p>


<h4>2.</h4>

<p>He was, indeed, becoming more and more engrossed.
He spent hours talking to that profound student of roulette,
Galloway MacTaggart. One evening he told the big
spectacled Scotchman of the time he had so nearly come
a cropper.</p>

<p>“Ah! ma lad,” said MacTaggart, “if it’s the simple
chances ye want tae play, don’t play the pair and the impair.
They’re the maist treacherous o’ the three. The
black and red are the maist popular. The colour catches
folk’s fancy. But for steady, logical playin’, play the
passe and the manque. There’s no many do it, but Ah’ve
tested it oot, an’ it’s the maist conseestent o’ the three.
I can’t tell ye why, but there ye are.”</p>

<p>Mr. Gimp put him onto another twist in the game.
“When you see a big bunch of money staked on one of the
simple chances, put a louis on the opposite one. You’ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
have a win three times out of five. It stands to reason.
You’re playing with the bank instead of against it. And
you know the bank’s winning a million a week.”</p>

<p>Learning a little here, and a little there, Hugh became
more and more identified with that crafty band that contrives
to make a living out of the Casino. Their numbers
are few but their tenacity undeniable. Year after
year these lean, neat men and fat, frowsy women manage
with a few hundred francs of capital to scratch up
the daily louis or so necessary to provide them with food,
shelter, and clothing. They are known as the Limpits,
because they hang on. Their faces are anxious until they
have made what they call “the material”; then they relax
pleasantly.</p>

<p>He was a member of the inner circle, one of those who
meet at the Casino as at a club, discussing the gossip of
the moment, the latest plunger, the latest <i>decavé</i>, the
latest suicide. Jarvis Tope was the recognized president
of the Casino Gossip Circle. He seemed to know everything
and everybody.</p>

<p>“You remember,” he said one day, “that Italian nobleman,
the Count Viviano, old, dried-up, proud-looking fish;
said to have gambled away lands, castles, fortunes over
these tables? Well, he was found last week in a bare
room in Beausoleil; nothing in it at all, nothing. He was
lying stark naked on the floor, a perfect skeleton. Literally
starved to death.... Ah! there’s the Princess. I
see she has pawned her set of sables. Poor thing! Excuse
me, I must go and inquire after her health.”</p>

<p>He toddled after a weird looking Russian woman who
was said to have had all her family massacred by the
Bolshevics.</p>

<p>Hugh became more and more conscious of a growing air<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
of suspicion in the Rooms. The inspectors seemed to be
keeping an unusually close watch scrutinizing all who
played with unwonted keenness. There was an anxious
expression on the faces of the directors who emerged
from the mirror doors that open by hidden springs. And
one day in a circular window high over the “Hall of
Lights,” Hugh saw a peering face; that of Krantz, the
great Krantz, and he, too, looked anxious.</p>

<p>It was Mr. Gimp who enlightened him. Mr. Gimp took
from his pocket a reddish counter with “20” marked on
it in silvery letters.</p>

<p>“What’s that? Tell me?” he asked, handing it to
Hugh.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s a chip for a louis,—Casino money.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s a chip for a louis, but is it Casino money?—that’s
the question—I don’t know. You don’t know.
They don’t know. Nobody knows.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I mean that it may be Casino money, or it may be an
exact imitation. When I say <i>exact</i> I mean so perfect that
not even an expert with a magnifying glass can tell
the difference. You couldn’t even call it a counterfeit,
for it may be a duplication of Casino money. Don’t you
see what they’re up against? Since the war they can’t
play with silver and gold. They’ve got to issue these
damn things and any crook can make them. Once they’re
in circulation who’s going to tell them from the genuine
ones?”</p>

<p>“But can they do nothing to check it?”</p>

<p>“What can they do? If it was a case of the big blue
hundred franc chips they might keep some sort of tabs on
them. They are all numbered and the numbers only run
up to ten thousand. But when you come to the louis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
counters there must be about a million of them and they
have no distinctive mark of any kind. It’s them that
make the Casino people such an easy mark. You see
notices all over the place imploring you to cash in before
you leave the building, but half of the players don’t do it.
They take the chips away in their pockets. They are
used around the town like cash; they are accepted as payment
for hotel bills. It’s impossible to keep track of them.
Why, they say there are over a hundred thousand francs
worth of false counters in circulation right now. And
the number’s increasing every day. There’s a gang hard
at work this very minute shooting them out. I tell you,
son, it’s one of the slickest gangs that ever hit this dump.
No one knows who they are. I may be one of them. You
may be one of them.”</p>

<p>“Thank you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m speaking just to demonstrate my point. No
one knows anything about any one else in this place. For
all I know you may be in the pay of the police, or for all
you know I may be. Between friends, though, I’m neither
a crook nor a detective, but just a common or garden
boob—like yourself.”</p>

<p>“They must be worried, the outfit upstairs?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess they’re lying awake nights, some of ’em.
For don’t you see, a man can play with the counterfeit
chips, and if he loses, no matter. But if he wins they pay
him real chips and he is in right. He goes on calmly playing
with the bank’s own money. Oh, it’s a cinch! And
the point of the joke is that there is no law against it.
You’re not counterfeiting money, you’re counterfeiting
counters. And for gambling purposes, too. Why, if
they found you out, I don’t believe they could legally do
anything to you. Anyway they would never bring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
such a case into court. They ain’t seeking publicity of
that kind. Nop, the worst they could do would be to fire
you over the frontier and take care you never came back.
I tell you I rather admire the bunch that are putting this
thing over. If I was broke and desperate, I’d do the
same.”</p>

<p>“And what do you suppose the Casino crowd are doing
about it?”</p>

<p>“Everything they can. Taking away the cards of every
one they suspect. Watching us all. Krantz is a cute one.
It’s only a question of time before he gets on.... By
Christopher! pipe that man coming out of the Rooms.
That man’s your double; that’s the Honourable Paul Vulning.”</p>

A SLAVE OF THE WHEEL</h3>
</div>

<h4>1.</h4>

<p class="drop-cap2">LOOKING in the direction in which Mr. Gimp’s
finger pointed Hugh saw a tall, slim man sauntering
across the hall. He had fair hair, brushed
smoothly back, and features of the conventional English
regularity.</p>

<p>“He’s like you and yet he ain’t,” commented Mr. Gimp.
“You’re fresh and he’s a bit used up. He’s just what
you’d be like in ten years’ time if you went the pace something
fierce. A gay dog! He’s got a villa up on the hill.
They say there are strange goings on at that same villa.
He’s got a swell car, too. He owes all over the place,
but he always seems to have heaps of cash to spend.
That’s Mrs. Emslie speaking to him. A terrible woman,
she is. I expect she’s trying to borrow from him. She’d
do anything for money, that woman. She’s getting so
desperate.”</p>

<p>“Pity for the daughter!”</p>

<p>“Yep, poor kid. Say, I saw her on the terrace early
this morning, all alone in the corner beside the baths. So
I went up and I says: ‘Well, Honey, how goes it?’ She
turned round, and blamed if she wasn’t crying. ‘Couldn’t
be worse,’ she says. ‘We’ve lost everything. Mother
won’t stop. She’s borrowing from all sorts of horrid people.
I think she’s mad. I don’t know what’s going to
become of us.’”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>“What will become of them?”</p>

<p>To this Mr. Gimp replied only by an eloquent shrug of
his shoulders.</p>

<p>Hugh watched Paul Vulning with a curious fascination.
As Vulning stared superciliously at the crowd Mrs. Emslie
talked to him feverishly, trying to hold his attention.
Then they sauntered away together.</p>

<p>“You see that big jolly man,” Mr. Gimp observed,
“the one with the black skull cap. Well, that’s the slickest
player ever hit this skin-game joint. That man never
loses. They call him ‘Cheero,’ because every time the
zero comes up he calls out: ‘Cheero.’ That man’s always
smiling. He goes about his business quietly, but believe
me, he’s just salting away the dough. He claims he can
hypnotize the croupiers and make them throw where he
wants.”</p>

<p>“What rot!”</p>

<p>“No more rot than lots of other systems.... See that
tall woman in grey just crossing the hall. Nobody knows
who she is, and what’s more, nobody’s ever seen her face.
She always wears that thick veil. They call her <i>Number
One</i>, because she goes from table to table, always playing
on the number one. At night she goes off to Nice in a
covered car. Some say she’s an Indian Princess, some say
it’s cancer. Any way, nobody knows what’s behind that
veil. She’s one of the Casino’s mysteries.”</p>

<p>“What queer characters!”</p>

<p>“Queer! Why, we all get queer if we stay here long
enough. I’m queer. You’ll get queer. MacTaggart’s
getting queerer every day. Yep, it’s a queer place....
Say, if I was a writing man I could make a dozen books
out of it. There’s a mine of material here. It’s fantastic;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
it ain’t real. It’s a stage show. Yes siree, it’s the queerest
place on earth.”</p>

<p>They sauntered over to the “Hall of Gloom,” and sat
on a padded bench near the door of the private rooms.
As they watched the stream of people coming and going,
Hugh noticed two ladies, one matronly, the other old and
decrepit. They were dressed alike, with big roses in their
hats and feather boas.</p>

<p>“Mother and daughter,” said Mr. Gimp. “They’re
known as the two Roses. The mother’s over eighty, but
she simply cannot stay away from the Rooms. She sits
at the table, her face level with the cloth, her hands clutching
a few counters. Sometimes she has fits and has to be
carried out. She should be on her knees in some church
instead of goggling and gasping over that bloody board....
There was another old lady, nice, serene, gentle, fat,
who used to be known as ‘Queen Victoria,’ because she
resembled the late Queen. She held a kind of levée every
day in the Rooms. But her friends took her home to
England, and they say she nearly died of lonesomeness
there. There’s lots like that, old folks tottering on the
edge of the tomb. They’d die in the Rooms if you’d let
’em.... Just look at that table over there. There’s
a man that’s blind and beside him a woman that’s paralyzed.
I tell you, folks come here that have to be carried
to the table. They’re half dead.”</p>

<p>“Do many die in the Rooms?”</p>

<p>“Suicide? Not on your life. It’s considered bad form.
As the English say: ‘It’s a thing that’s simply not done....’
By God! if I wanted to do it, I’d give ’em a jar.
I’d go to that centre table and lean well over the wheel;
then I’d start pumping lead into my bean. I’d cover
that table with gore. A bucket of blood. I’d spatter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
my brains over the damned croupiers. I can see the <i>Chef
de Partie</i> wiping them out of the corner of his eye....”</p>

<p>“What a ghastly idea! I hope you’re not seriously
thinking of such a thing.”</p>

<p>Mr. Gimp cackled with laughter. “You don’t know
me, son. I’m not that sort. Still I’ve got a kind of idea
in my old head I’ll make a sensational exit. I have a
notion that when I go, I’ll go with a bang. I don’t just
know how, but there it is....”</p>


<h4>2.</h4>

<p>In the week that followed Hugh saw a good deal of
Paul Vulning. The latter liked to swing round the
“Cheese” in his long low carmine-coloured car. He leaned
back, driving with studied nonchalance. On one occasion,
he narrowly shaved Hugh and Mr. MacTaggart. The big
Scotchman shook a wrathful fist after him.</p>

<p>“The dawmed swanker! Ye’d think he wis rinnin’ the
place. Ah’ll gie him a puck on the gub yin o’ thae days
that’ll teach him tae look doon his neb at folk better than
himsel’. I’ve got ma eye on him. I’ve seen him aboot a
lot wi’ Mrs. Emslie lately. Ye can tak’ me word for it
he’s up tae nae guid.”</p>

<p>And sure enough the very next day Hugh saw Mrs.
Emslie and her daughter in the carmine car. Vulning
had a squint-eyed chauffeur who sat with him as he drove.
The mother and girl were behind. On their return he
saw them again; but this time, June Emslie was in front
with the chauffeur, while Vulning was behind with the
mother.</p>

<p>That evening, he met the two women once more,—this
time on the Avenue des Fleurs. As he passed them in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
darkness, he heard the mother’s voice tense with anger.
He never again saw the daughter waiting in the atrium,
but Mrs. Emslie, her white cheeks painted, her eyes burning,
gambled more desperately than ever.</p>

<p>Hugh himself was trying a new system which was behaving
rather decently. He put two louis on the manque
and a louis on one of the transversals of the passe. If it
came manque he won a louis; if he struck the transversal
he won seven louis. He did not play until certain indications
told him he had the odds in his favour. He had to a
curious degree that sense of probability which is so valuable
to the player of roulette. Occasionally he had a
hard tussle with the bank, but on the whole he averaged
a hundred francs a day. In addition to this he made two
louis for the running of the house. He was greatly pleased
and used to say to Margot:</p>

<p>“Isn’t it jolly to think that every mouthful we eat, we
make the Casino pay for? Doesn’t it make the food taste
ever so much sweeter?”</p>

<p>“That’s not much of a compliment to my cooking.”</p>

<p>“You’re cooking’s delicious, my child. It’s the things
you don’t cook. By the way I made a couple of louis
extra to-day, so here’s something for you. You can regard
it as a present from the <i>Société</i>.”</p>

<p>The gift was a pair of suede gloves. It was a joke of
which he never tired, that of giving her a present and
saying: “With the compliments of the Casino.”</p>

<p>He had come to love their big bright room. It was a
refuge, a retreat from the fever and fret of the tables.
Here was reality, the simple things that mattered; there,
a false splendour, a theatrical pretentiousness. Margot
considered his growing fondness for home a victory for
her, and increased her efforts to make it attractive. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
bought many little furnishings, so that the living part
became extremely comfortable. But behind the big green
curtain their sleeping arrangements remained unchanged.
The small grey curtain divided his part from hers. This
curtain seemed to him to have a definite significance. It
was the symbol of his honour. It was the frailest of barriers,
yet by the expression of his will it had become more
solid than a sheet of steel. It seemed curious at night
to think that she was so close. He often heard her breathing.
Perhaps she was his for the taking. But then she
trusted him. He would open his eyes and look at the
grey curtain with a certain grim exultation. Good job
it was grey. Maybe if it had been orange or crimson,
or some colour that appealed to the senses, he might have
been tempted to tear it aside.... But grey had a sobering
effect.</p>

<p>Not that he would have yielded to temptation. He
was not that sort, he told himself. If any such intention
had ventured into his mind, he would have stamped on it
as he would on a snake. He had pride and strength. He
was clean-minded, cool-blooded. He was equal to the
situation he had created. Yet it was oddly pleasant to
have her so close to him. What did she think? he sometimes
wondered. She, too, accepted the situation and
played the game as honourably as he. They were like
brother and sister.</p>

<p>He had to admit that every day she was growing more
attractive. As if to please him she had taken to dressing
her hair in the English fashion; parting it over the forehead,
and massing it in a thick pleat at the nape of her
neck. The slight hollowing of her cheeks and the sweetness
of her mouth reminded him of Rossetti’s women. She
did not have much colouring; her skin was like ivory, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
the faint pink of her cheeks that of a sea shell. He made
a good many sketches of her; and told himself that some
day he would paint her portrait.</p>

<p>But, for the time being, the Goddess Roulette claimed
him as her own. She brooked no rival. There in the
gaiety and the golden sunshine, he thought roulette,
dreamed roulette, lived roulette. He was a worshipper
among a host of worshippers, their temple the Casino;
and few worshippers at a sacred shrine are so devoted.</p>

<p>One night he had a dream.</p>

<p><i>The vast hollow of the sky seemed to be the
bowl of a mighty wheel. The ball rolled with
the long menace of thunder and shot into its slot
like a lightning stab. Beneath the shadow of this sinister
wheel, the air was grey with fluttering bank-notes, the
earth was like an ant-heap of fevered, frenzied men and
women. As they leaped at the money it nearly always
evaded them. With each leap they grew more feeble.
Then he noticed that the ground beneath them was a
quagmire, into which they were sinking. Their struggles
plunged them deeper and deeper into the ooze, until they
disappeared from sight. But no sooner had they gone
than others took their place. They, too, leaped and
clutched at the elusive fortune, only to sink in turn. And
over them the great shadowy wheel rumbled and flashed,
taking the place of God and the stars</i>.... It was all so
vivid that he awoke shuddering and crying aloud: “The
wheel! The wheel!”</p>

<p>But no dream could damp his ardour, nor cloud his
happiness. He was superbly happy. He told himself it
was because of the beauty and charm of the place. Monte
Carlo in its setting of primitive grandeur, glutted with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
luxury, and gorged with light; man’s insolent triumph
over nature; a cocotte of price poised amid the eternal
verities of mountain and sea. He adored it. Its keynote
was joy. Life glittered and sang. Every day was a fête
day. He loved the feeling that he was part of it, one of
its gay pleasure-seekers. That was the side of it he chose
to see. What if there was another, a sinister one! As
far as he was concerned it did not exist. Ruin, suicide,
misery, all these were lies of blackmailing journalists.
The gambling was a harmless diversion indulged in by
people who lost what they could afford to lose. Those
who fell were only the weak who would have gone to the
wall in some other way. No, it was the most adorable
place on earth.</p>

<p>One evening as he climbed the long hill to the Casino,
his thoughts were of the pleasantest. The night was rich
with velvet darkness. A sense of rain lurked in the crystal
purity of the air, a soft reluctant rain that might
come before morning. On the concrete blocks that protect
the harbour the little lights of fishermen made swirls
of gold, and their nets moved round and round, scooping
up the fish attracted by the glow. The water of the
harbour was as black as patent leather, and the quay
lamps shot down long bright stems that sprouted into
silver foliage. The few lights on the dark heights of
Monaco seemed only to accentuate its mystery.</p>

<p>He stood for a while where the white bust of Berloitz
springs on a shaft of marble from a patch of purple
pansies. He looked past the fiery frontages of the vast
hotels, to where, above them all, the cornice of the Riviera
Palace appeared like an agraffe of pearls. He inhaled
deeply the breath of the sea. How well he felt! Never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
since the year before the war, when he played cricket and
football, had he felt so fit. He was a man again, ready
to tackle the job of life.</p>

<p>As he walked past the band-stand the Casino windows
made panels of orange against the biscuit-coloured stone.
No, he would not play again that night. One must not
abuse one’s luck. He had already made three hundred
francs. He had now a thousand of the bank’s money to
gamble with. To-morrow he would buy ten chips of a
hundred francs each and play with them instead of with
louis. He was full of confidence. To-morrow the battle
again; to-night the joy of victory. He rounded the
corner where the grounds of the Casino overhang the
station, and entered the quieter garden beyond. Finding
a shadowed seat he sat down to smoke. He was soon in
a happy reverie.</p>

<p>A rock garden close by formed a small plateau on
which was a pergola. Suddenly his attention was drawn
to it. He saw two people emerge from the shadow. At
first he thought they were lovers; then he noticed they
were struggling. As he bent forward trying to pierce
the darkness he heard a woman’s faint cry of distress.
Rising swiftly, he ran towards them.</p>

PLUNGING</h3>
</div>

<h4>1.</h4>

<p class="drop-cap">A MAN in evening dress was holding a girl and
trying to draw her closer to him.</p>

<p>“Leave me alone,” she moaned; “let me go or
I’ll scream for help. I will, I tell you....”</p>

<p>“You little fool! As if a kiss or two would hurt you.
Come on, I’ve got the car down below. Let me take you
for a spin.”</p>

<p>“No, no. Let me go home to mother.”</p>

<p>He laughed. “You know your mother’s in the Casino
playing the fool, with money I lent her,—the last, by
God! she ever gets from me,—unless you are more amiable.
I say, let’s go over to Ciro’s and have something.”</p>

<p>“Oh, please let me go. You’re hurting me. I must find
mother. She wouldn’t like me to be alone here.”</p>

<p>“Bah! As long as she can gamble, your precious
mother doesn’t care two pins what you do. Why, she
knows you’re with me. She’s got an extra thousand to-night
to keep out of the way. Come on, be reasonable!
I’ll save your mother yet; but you’ve got to be pretty
nice. Here, another kiss....”</p>

<p>“Oh, no. Please don’t. You forget yourself. You’ve
been drinking. Let me go, I say, let me go....”</p>

<p>His answer was to clutch her more fiercely. With a
sudden wrench she freed herself and broke away. He
stood swaying for a moment, then with a drunken laugh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
sprang after her. His arms were once more about to
close around her when Hugh leapt forward and dealt him
a blow. The man went down.</p>

<p>The girl had turned. In the radiance of an arc-light
Hugh saw her fear-distorted face.</p>

<p>“Miss Emslie!”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” she panted. “Oh, please help me. I’m
afraid....”</p>

<p>“You needn’t be afraid. I’ll deal with this chap.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know you, but I’ve seen you often. How can
I thank you....”</p>

<p>“Never mind about that. Run home to your friends.”</p>

<p>She vanished. As the man rose Hugh recognized Paul
Vulning, his face flushed with wine and deadly with rage.</p>

<p>“You young devil, you! Why did you do that?”</p>

<p>“Because under the circumstances it seemed the proper
thing to do.”</p>

<p>“Is it the proper thing to interfere in an affair that
doesn’t concern you?”</p>

<p>“Her friends are my friends.”</p>

<p>“Who the devil are you? I’ve never met you. If it
were not for these fellows there I’d thrash you.”</p>

<p>“These fellows” were two firemen who had appeared
from the shadow. Probably they had been there all the
time but had not judged the moment opportune to intervene.
Hugh laughed.</p>

<p>“We needn’t let that stand in our way. If there’s
thrashing to be done, I expect we can find lots of quiet
places down on the beach.”</p>

<p>“I would be a fool to do that. I don’t know who you
are. You may be a crook for all I know.”</p>

<p>“I may be. You don’t know me. But I know you for
a rotter and a cad.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>Paul Vulning’s face grew purple in its fury. Throwing
discretion to the winds, he rushed and swung a heavy
blow. The two firemen valiantly tried to come between
them, and one of them received the vicious swing intended
for Hugh. Angered, he too struck out. There threatened
to be a general mix-up, when a voice, suave but edged
with authority, made them all turn.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, gentlemen, what’s this about? Do you
want to be arrested?”</p>

<p>A tall dark man, with a lean intelligent face and a
bland smile, seemed to have sprung from nowhere. It
was Krantz. He continued smoothly:</p>

<p>“I would strongly recommend you both to go home.
You know, gentlemen, we don’t want trouble in the Principality.
Peace, perfect peace is our ideal. Be advised,
messieurs: go home.”</p>

<p>Paul Vulning’s jaw had dropped, and he was staring
at Krantz with a look that was half fascination, half
fear. Then with a glower of hate at Hugh, he strode
away.</p>

<p>The next day, as he had planned, Hugh played with
placques and won a thousand francs. On his way out
he met Mr. Gimp. The little lean man seemed agitated
as he fumbled over “the makings.” He pursed out his
underlip grimly.</p>

<p>“Heard the news?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Emslie ... she’s gone ... the veronal route....”</p>


<h4>2.</h4>

<p>One morning Hugh awoke joyously and sang as he
dressed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>“You seem very gay,” said Margot, “considering you
came home so very late last night.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it was a gala night at Café de Paris. Masked
dancers and all that sort of thing. Very jolly. But I’m
gay for another reason. Look....”</p>

<p>He spread on the table five notes of a thousand francs
each. “There! Gaze, gloat, marvel—the bank’s money.”</p>

<p>Her obvious awe was touched with anxiety.</p>

<p>“And you’ve made all that?”</p>

<p>“All.”</p>

<p>“You’re wonderful. You’ll stop now, I hope.”</p>

<p>“Stop nothing! I’m going on. I’ve got a lucky
streak.”</p>

<p>“You’ll lose it all again.”</p>

<p>“<i>Tant pis!</i> I’m going to risk it. I’m going to play big.
I say, you’d better come and watch me.”</p>

<p>“Never! I couldn’t. The emotion! It would be painful.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I love,—the emotion. The moment, just
before the ball drops, when the heart seems to pause.
Whether one wins or loses one has that precious thrill.
Come.”</p>

<p>“No, thank you.”</p>

<p>Alone Hugh climbed the familiar hill. On his left
towered huge hotels, on his right the water of the gem-like
harbour was like lapis lazuli, the quays like porcelain.
Dainty yachts, all varnish and brasswork, glassed themselves
exquisitely. A carmine car dashed past him. Hugh
caught a glimpse of Paul Vulning at the wheel. The seat
raked so that he seemed to be lying down. Beside him
sat the cross-eyed chauffeur.</p>

<p>Hugh entered the Rooms with no definite plan of playing.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
His five thousand francs were folded up into a small
packet. It was curious, he thought as he fingered it, how
suddenly he seemed to lose all sense of its value. It was
not money at all, merely a ball of worthless paper. A
magnificent recklessness came over him. Going to the first
table, he took from his pocket the greasy wad of notes
and threw it on red. There it was gone, that crumpled
soiled packet. He was rid of it. In another moment that
silly little ball would drop into a black slot, and he would
turn away with a careless smile.... No, it had dropped
into a red. How funny! He saw everybody turn to
look at him. He stood in a daze while the croupier
unfolded his notes, counted them and paid him five more.
He had been in the Casino just one minute and he had
made five thousand francs.</p>

<p>He was back in his room half an hour after he had left
it. He spread his ten notes out on the table. Margot
looked at him with admiration and anxiety. He enjoyed
the admiration.</p>

<p>“Come on,” he said; “I won’t play any more to-day.
We’ll go to Nice for lunch and make an afternoon of it.”</p>

<p>The next day he followed his impulse again, and threw
five thousand francs on black. He lost. Going to another
table he played again on black and won. The situation
was unchanged, but his nerves were a little uncertain.</p>

<p>The following day he hesitated; but finally, after taking
three imaginary losses, he played for a win, and got it.
He had now fifteen thousand francs.</p>

<p>On the fourth day his nerve failed him. After watching
the play, making up his mind, then hesitating and
drawing back again he came away without having played.</p>

<p>On the fifth day he played a well-known <i>coup</i> that comes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
off three times out of five. After a long run on black, a
break and a return to black, he played on red and won.
Twenty thousand francs.</p>

<p>That afternoon like a miser he spread his twenty big
notes all over the table, and a sudden exaggerated sense
of their value came to him. Twenty thousand francs!
Why, it meant Capital. In some quiet country place he
could live for three or four years on that; buy himself an
interest in a business, get a good start in life again. The
Casino had served him well.</p>

<p>Margot looked at him with growing anxiety. “You’ll
stop now, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“No, I haven’t got enough yet.”</p>

<p>“<i>Mon Dieu!</i> How much do you want?”</p>

<p>“Sixty thousand! I want to buy a good car for about
twenty thousand. Then there’s a little cottage with a big
garden at Villefranche I can get for another twenty. Between
the car and the garden I think I can make a pretty
tidy living.”</p>

<p>“And the third twenty?”</p>

<p>“That’s for you, my child. What the French call a
<i>dot</i>, the day you marry.”</p>

<p>“And if I never marry?”</p>

<p>“Well, then, you’ll keep house for me in my little cottage
covered with roses. You’ll still be my little sister.”</p>

<p>“That’s nicer. Now you can stop at forty thousand.”</p>

<p>“No. I’m an obstinate brute. Sixty thousand goes.”</p>

<p>The girl sighed. “By the way we have a new neighbour,
such a fine looking old man, a Professor Durand.”</p>

<p>“The dickens! I know him quite well. He’s a little
touched. Thinks he has an invincible system that’s
going to bust up the Casino.”</p>

<p>“Yes, the concierge told me. He has books and books<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
of figures and diagrams. He works over them night and
day.”</p>

<p>“Seems to me the concierge takes too much interest in
his <i>locataires</i>. I don’t like that man. I wish you would
talk to him as little as possible.”</p>

<p>“Very well. I don’t like him myself, he ... he tried to
make love to me.”</p>

<p>“The dog! I’ll smash him.”</p>

<p>“No, please don’t make a fuss. I stopped him pretty
quick. It doesn’t do to make enemies of those people.”</p>

<p>The following day Hugh met Professor Durand on the
stairway. The old man was bronzed and hale-looking.</p>

<p>“Ha! my young friend!” he said. “Yes, I’ve been in
the mountains, the pines, preparing for the battle. I
want all the strength that is left in me to accomplish my
mission.”</p>

<p>“Poor old chap!” thought Hugh, “he doesn’t know
what’s in front of him. Pathetic! Maybe another Casino
tragedy.”</p>


<h4>3.</h4>

<p>As he was sitting in the Café de Paris that evening
listening to the music, Hugh idly watched the entrance
to the Casino with its four great lanterns. In the softened
lustre its pale yellow stone took on a mellow radiance almost
onyxlike. Seen through the palms with the stars
for a background it was like a gleaming palace of delight,
poised over the mystery of the sea.</p>

<p>Into the pool of light from the doorway swished glossy
limousines from which descended elegantly dressed people.
One, a very tall man, mounted the steps and paused for
a moment. He had a spade-shaped beard, a swarthy
face, and a hooked nose.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>“First time I’ve seen that chap,” thought Hugh.
“Looks like a grandee of old Castile, but is probably an
Armenian money-changer.”</p>

<p>Just at that moment Mr. Tope came bustling up. “I
say,” said Hugh, “who’s that hidalgo-looking johnny on
the steps?”</p>

<p>Mr. Tope screwed a monocle into his right eye. “Don’t
know exactly. Some say he’s a South American, ex-president
of some small republic who got away with the state
treasure. Wouldn’t be surprised. He has a vulturish
look. The scum of the world find their way here, and as
long as they have money they are welcome. By the way,
I hear great things of you, winning maximums and so
on. Congratulations, young man! Any one who can get
ahead of that institution over there has my profound admiration.
You know, my boy, they’re making a million
a week; and they say there’s a suicide a day. I believe
that’s an exaggeration, though. If they put it at six
a week they might be nearer the truth. I suppose you’ve
heard of the latest one?...”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“That big man with the skull cap; they used to call
him ‘Cheero.’”</p>

<p>“Really!”</p>

<p>“Prussic acid in the Café of the Casino. They always
said he was the luckiest player in the Rooms, the man
who never lost. As it turned out he did nothing but lose;
he lost a million and hid it behind that placid smile. That
smile was a mask that hid his agony....”</p>

<p>“Pretty rough! One never knows. Oh, I say, I haven’t
seen anything of the Calderbrooks lately.”</p>

<p>“No, they’re lying low at present. They went through
their letter of credit and then borrowed from the bank.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
The old man wanted to go home, but the two women persuaded
him to stay another month. They put a mortgage
on their house, and are having two thousand pounds sent
out.”</p>

<p>“And what about Mrs. Emslie’s daughter?”</p>

<p>“Oh, June. The Fitzoswalds have taken her in. Poor
girl! She was very ill after the tragedy. We wanted to
send her to England, but it seems she has no relatives
there. They come from Australia. The mother gambled
away all the girl’s fortune and the poor thing is alone in
the world, helpless and destitute.”</p>

<p>“Is she better now?”</p>

<p>“Yes. The mother led her an awful life. June is helping
Mrs. Fitzoswald to look after the kiddies. You know
Mrs. Fitz? Spunky little Irishwoman with bronze gold
hair and a turned up nose! Fitz is that red-headed, one-legged
man; always plays the same game, builds up louis
round the number thirty-two. He says it is his wife’s
age, but she denies it. She says she wishes Fitz would
hurry up and be ruined, for then they could go home to
Ireland and live in peace. Well, they’re awfully fine people,
and so good to June. I say, young man, there’s a
chance for you. A sweet, pretty, refined girl, friendless
and without a <i>sou</i>. Why don’t you sail in, marry her
and be happy ever after?”</p>

<p>“But I’ve never had the faintest idea of marrying.”</p>

<p>“Ah well, poor June must become a nurse or a governess,
or fall into the clutches of some professional seducer
such as Vulning. I’ve heard he’s after her. I hope the
Major gets ruined pretty soon, and then the Fitzoswalds
can take June away from this infected hell.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span></p>


<h4>4.</h4>

<p>The very next day Hugh encountered June Emslie. She
was playing with the Fitzoswald children in the circular
sand pit near the dove-cage. She started and grew pale;
then advanced to meet him with outstretched hand.
Neither of them referred to the previous meeting. He
found her timid, painfully embarrassed, but shyly worshipping
as she looked at him. Come to think of it, he
had made rather an effective entry on the scene that
night, quite in the hero of romance fashion. If she was
at all sentimental she must have idealized him. Being a
prosaic young man he was rather annoyed at the thought
and his manner became brusque, careless even. Her recent
sorrow had not driven the fresh colour from her
cheeks. If Margot was the type of the lily this girl
was like a rose. Her features were sensitive and delicate,
her hair a dark chestnut, her eyes deep blue. She
was tall, and slender, and apparently not more than seventeen.
After a few commonplace remarks, he said:</p>

<p>“If I can do anything for you, anything at all, please
let me know. Think of me as a friend, and call on me
if ever you should need me.”</p>

<p>She understood what he meant and a deep flush overspread
her face.</p>

<p>“Yes, I will. Thank you so much. By the way,—I
don’t know your name.”</p>

<p>He told her. “Shall I write it down?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Oh no. I assure you I can remember it.”</p>

<p>They said good-bye and he left her with an impression
of her virginal sweetness and budding charm.</p>

<p>But she did not remain long in his thoughts. That
afternoon he had an engagement with Mrs. Belmire. Of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
late she had gone out of her way to be nice to him, and
he had begun to admire her enthusiastically. He was
proud to be seen with her, and was blind to her deficiencies.
She had for him the attraction of the ripe, experienced
woman for the raw, callow youth. When she asked him
to take her to Cap Martin, her request made him simmer
with joyous excitement.</p>

<p>He called for her in a voiture with two horses and they
drove along the shore road. She was simpler and sweeter
than he had ever known her; but, he thought, abstracted
and depressed. They sat on the rocks awhile, then had
tea in the hotel. On the way home her pensiveness increased
so noticeably that at last he taxed her with it.</p>

<p>“I say, what’s the matter? You seem so sad to-day.”</p>

<p>She turned with a forced smile. “Am I? Perhaps I
am. You see I’m worried. But then what have my troubles
got to do with you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, please tell me. Look on me as a friend.”</p>

<p>“Dear boy, so I do. Well, I’m in difficulties—financial
difficulties. I’ve got money coming out from England;
but I’ve had such rotten luck at baccarat lately, and a
lot of little bills have been coming in, and ... well, this
is all I have to meet them.”</p>

<p>From her vanity bag she took a tiny jewelled purse,
and showed him in its satin interior a few torn franc bills
and some <i>sous</i>.</p>

<p>“Grotesque, isn’t it? I wouldn’t care, only there’s my
week’s bill at the pension. I’ll pull through somehow....”</p>

<p>Hugh thrilled with sympathy; he blushed, stammered
and blurted out: “I say, I’ve been rather lucky at the
tables lately. Won’t you let me help you ... a little
loan....”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>“Oh, no, I couldn’t think of it.”</p>

<p>“It will be a privilege. Make me happy, please, by accepting.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you put it that way. I know you’ve been
lucky, dear boy. You’re just too nice. Perhaps a <i>mille</i>
would tide me over.”</p>

<p>Hugh feverishly searched his pocket-book. Alas! he
had prudently left his big bills with Margot. All he had
were some twenty ten franc notes.</p>

<p>“Look here, it’s too bad,” he said, “I’ve left all my
money at home. But, to-night, if you can meet me at the
Café de Paris at nine, I’ll have it.”</p>

<p>“I can count on that?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“You darling! I say ... there’s no one on the road.
Quick. If you like, you may kiss me.”</p>


<h4>5.</h4>

<p>He arrived at the Café de Paris about half past eight,
keyed up and exalted. The afternoon seemed to have
added an inch to his stature. The most charming woman
in Monte!... And he had kissed her.... Having a
little time to spare he went into the Rooms. The impulse
he knew so well was luring him on.</p>

<p>“If I give her a <i>mille</i>,” he thought, “why not make the
Casino pay for it?”</p>

<p>At the first table he threw a maximum on red and won.
Rather sourly they paid him six thousand francs.</p>

<p>“Five thousand for me,” he said, “and a thousand for
Mrs. B.”</p>

<p>He found her exquisitely dressed and impatiently awaiting
him. His luck had added to his excitement. He was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
feeling capable of any folly. He folded up a <i>mille</i> note
very neatly and slipped it into her bag. Then somewhat
to his chagrin she excused herself.</p>

<p>“I’m awfully sorry. I have an engagement at the club.
Probably see you to-morrow.”</p>

<p>She left him feeling rather chilled and sober.</p>

<p>“Well,” he consoled himself, “perhaps it is just as well.
In any case I now have twenty-five thousand francs.”</p>

<p>He did not play for the next few days. His success
rather dismayed him; his nerve was gone. Then on two
successive days a chance appeared which was too favourable
to be resisted; it was what he called a sure-shot.
As a matter of fact, it really came off in five cases out of
six, but only by watching and waiting could one get on
to it. A long run on one of the simple chances had to be
followed by a certain combination of both chances. In
each case when he played it he won; his capital had now
increased to thirty-five thousand francs.</p>

<p>He began to feel what he had never felt in his life before,—secure.
To a rich man that sum was nothing; to
him, everything. But he was becoming increasingly nervous.
He must not lose this money. He must be more
prudent than ever. If he lost it, it would discourage him
utterly; he would never have the heart to begin over
again. Yet he must make the sixty thousand on which
he had set his heart. Only twenty-five thousand more.
Four wins of maximums would practically do it. Well,
he must pluck up his courage and try again. He must
nerve himself for the final struggle.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER EIGHT<br />


THE BIG FIGHT</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">DURING his long spells of waiting, he became more
and more intimately acquainted with the world
of the Casino,—from the prowling seeker of the
sure-shot to the holiday plunger, from the philosophic
veteran with pencil and note-book to the <i>nouveau riche</i>
spraying the table with louis. He came to know the eternal
types, the avid-eyed old women, the blowsy, brazen
matron, the cocotte throwing money away with cynical
contempt, the young girl from the convent risking her
first five franc piece.</p>

<p>Then the unending Casino comedies. For instance, the
Honeymoon Couple comedy. The first day she hangs on
his arm while he plays. The second day <i>he</i> hangs on
her arm while <i>she</i> plays. The third day they separate
a little and try tiny flutters of their own. The fourth
day they get seats at the same table and advise each other
as to their play. The fifth day they get seats at separate
tables, and each plays as if the other did not exist. The
sixth day she is begging him for money, and he is refusing.
The seventh day they moon round without playing,
he moody, she sulky, very near to a quarrel. Then
on the eighth day they disappear, perhaps never to be
the same again.</p>

<p>Then there is the woman who talks to the croupier,
fawning on him and asking him how she ought to play.
Sometimes the knight of the rateau hazards a guess. If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
it comes off, <i>tant mieux</i>. Perhaps, it means a tip; if it
doesn’t, <i>tant pis</i>. No man is infallible.</p>

<p>These types repeat themselves endlessly; but among
them from time to time appear strange original characters
piquing the curiosity of the public. The Casino is like
a stage where they enter, play their parts, and make
their exit. Old and young, good and bad, rich and
poor,—they come and go; they lose or win; they sidle
across the glossy floor under the great white dome; they
smirk and posture, wrangle and vapour. Beefy Englishman
and desiccated Yank, flatulent Frenchman and oily
Italian, morose Spaniard and bovine Swede; Jap, Chinaman,
Rasta and Levantine Jew—they mix amid the
throng that surges around the whirring wheels, and their
strange tongues mingle in one confused babble.</p>

<p>So fantastic did it appear to Hugh that at times he
rubbed his eyes and wondered if it could be real. How
he wished he were a writer. If only he could see into their
hearts, know their histories, pick their brains, what books
he could write, a library of books, a document of humankind
that would outweigh the works of Balzac and Zola
combined.</p>

<p>He became better acquainted with daily frequenters of
the Casino and watched them with unceasing amusement.
There was one, a Greek, a grossly fat man with three
chins and a promontory of greasy waistcoat. On his
pudgy hand he wore rubies as large as walnuts; and as
he walked from table to table, laying <i>mille</i> placques on the
dozens he never ceased to perspire. The tall woman in
grey also attracted him. She was always gloved, always
veiled. She played with persistency her game on number
one, losing or winning with apparent indifference. Who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
was she? She went from table to table with the strangeness
and mystery of a specter.</p>

<p>His attention was drawn irresistibly to the very tall man
with the spade-shaped beard, who, he had learned, was a
Brazilian diplomat. His name was Doctor Bergius and
he was said to be of mixed Spanish and German parentage.
From the moment he had entered the Rooms, the doctor
had become a dominating personality. He was as straight
as a shoot of bamboo, with a high carriage and an
eye of piercing command. His long nose resembled the
beak of a vulture of the Andes; his brow retreated
from his piercing black eyes and his skin was as coppery
as that of an Indian. He always dressed with immaculate
care. He never played, but looking gravely on,
with his hands behind his back, appeared only remotely
interested in the game.</p>

<p>Then there was another man who attracted Hugh,
partly because he was so graceful and handsome, partly
because he had once broken the bank. He was an Italian
called Castelli, of medium height and well-shaped figure.
He had the olive skin, dark velvety eyes, and the perfect
features often found in men who prey on women. He
always had women with him. He played a dashing game,
superbly indifferent to loss or gain.</p>

<p>Hugh was conscious of an atmosphere of unceasing suspicion.
Every day hundreds of false louis were foisted
on the bank, and no one knew how it was done. It was
impossible to check them. Most of the players were too
lazy to cash in before leaving the Casino and the chips
continued to circulate in town as freely as money. The
Casino inspectors were up on their toes, every one was
being watched.</p>

<p>One day there came to him the mood for which he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
waiting, the conquering mood. His nerves were of steel,
and he felt that he could win a fortune or lose all without
turning a hair. He had in his pockets seven packets of
five thousand francs each. He sat down at the suicide
table and began to play.</p>

<p>It was strange how confident he was. Something was
fighting on his side. He could not be beaten. Then to his
dismay, he lost the first <i>coup</i>, but won the three following.
Again he lost a <i>coup</i>, but gained another two. And so
it went on. The scales dipped, now for, now against him.
On the whole, however, fortune favoured him, and he steadily
drew ahead.</p>

<p>At last the great battle was on. He felt inspired.
Silently he sat, watchful, emotionless as a wax figure.
His eyes became opaque; and a crease of concentration
came between his brows.</p>

<p>“A big game,” the rumour spread. “Come and see.”</p>

<p>The circle of watchers deepened and their interest increased.
But to Hugh they were only a dull blur of meaningless
faces. No, not all, for he saw one that thrilled
him for a moment. It was that of Mrs. Belmire. Then
her too he forgot in the stress of the struggle.</p>

<p>And it was in reality a struggle. The bank had abandoned
its attitude of disdain, and was directly fighting
him. No longer was he a petty “piker” but a foeman
worth while. He felt that the eight silent men in black
who ran the table were concentrating their wills against
his. Psychology was coming into play. He willed that
that capricious little ball should go one way; these eight
willed it to take another. He would beat them; he
would make the ball go where he wanted it to go.</p>

<p>He waited until it was spun; and then, acting from
sheer impulse, threw a packet of notes on one of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
simple chances. Sometimes he even threw on two chances.
The battle swayed. He advanced, he retreated, but only
to advance again.</p>

<p>As the spirit of the fight glowed in him, his play increased
in boldness. If he fell he would fall gloriously.
For once he had the centre of the stage. He would be
worthy of the part, of the audience. He began to play
on all three simple chances. He won ... and won again.
Fortune favoured the brave. Hurrah for the big game!
Again a triple shot. Ha! he had lost one of the three
that time.... Well, the next time. The grey croupier
who was paying did not look at all pleased. No wonder!
Handing out <i>mille</i> notes continually from the little grilled
box. And the <i>chef de parti</i> was scowling at the little chap
who twirled the ball. Hugh won another <i>coup</i>, another
fifteen thousand.</p>

<p>“<i>Messieurs, le boule passe.</i>”</p>

<p>The cowards! They were changing the croupier who
threw the ball. That one was too unlucky. What a
stack of notes he had. Must be nearly a hundred thousand.
Ah, the devil! this new man was beating him. He
had lost ... lost ... lost. His stack was diminishing.
His luck had turned. He heard people asking: “Why
doesn’t he stop?” No, he would win back again ... win
back. He was dazed. He scarcely knew what he was
doing. He was reaching out to play another time when
a hand gripped his arm.</p>

<p>“You darned young fool, quit now. Quit while you’re
still to the good.”</p>

<p>It was Mr. Gimp. The American dragged him away
from the table, followed by the admiring gaze of a hundred
eyes. Then in a corner they counted the gains.
With his own capital he had fifty-five thousand francs.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>He sat on a leather seat in a stupor. He wanted to
smoke a cigarette, to go home, but did not have energy
enough. Then, when he was finally starting the stranger’s
door swung open and Professor Durand made his first
entrance into the Rooms.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER NINE<br />


THE PROFESSOR BEGINS</h3>
</div>

<h4>1.</h4>

<p class="drop-cap">THE professor advanced with an impressive dignity.
Even the two blue-coated attendants who guarded
the middle portal stared and gaped. They were
used to strange figures, but never had they seen a stranger.</p>

<p>The professor wore a black frock-coat of a bygone
day. He carried a brigandish hat in one hand, and a cane
with an ebony knob in the other. His silvery hair coiled
over his shoulders; his deep, broad beard was patriarchal;
he walked with a slow, deliberate step. Every one turned
to look at him as he passed.</p>

<p>“It’s Father Christmas,” said a man, and everybody
tittered. The name stuck.</p>

<p>But the professor paid no attention to them. He
seemed to know just what he wanted to do. He went
straight to the table favoured by the system-player, the
one next the “Opium Dream Room”, and handed five
francs to the sour old lady who takes down the numbers
for the Monte Carlo Revue. Promptly she gave him her
place.</p>

<p>“Come,” said Hugh to Mr. Gimp, “I know the old chap.
He’s queer. Let’s watch him.”</p>

<p>Others too were hastening to watch, and expectancy
was in the air. The professor seemed entirely unconscious
of the interest he aroused. He carefully installed himself,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
then took from an inner pocket a long red note-book and
a pencil. He asked the old lady to show him her numbers,
and copied down the last dozen. Then taking out thirty
thousand francs in bills he demanded counters. There
was something so elaborately pretentious in these preparations
that even the croupiers looked at one another,
though they did not lose their contemptuous smiles.</p>

<p>The professor peered through his silver rimmed spectacles
at the numbers and sat for awhile, taking down the
fresh ones as they occurred, and consulting carefully his
long red note-book. Finally he stood up with an air of
decision, and put the maximum on thirty-two in every
possible way,—en plein, chevals, carrés, transversals, dozens
columns, simple chances. When he had finished he had
on the table about twenty-five thousand francs. Even
the croupiers stared. A thrill of excitement ran through
the circle of watchers, but the least moved was the old man.
He leaned back and waited with calm confidence for the
spin. It came. It was the number thirty-four. He had
lost.</p>

<p>Not all, though. It is true he had missed the number,
but he had got the three simple chances, the dozen, a
transversal double, a carée. He had won about ten thousand
francs.</p>

<p>The croupiers shrugged their shoulders. People looked
at each other with eyes that said, “Fool’s luck!” The professor
again consulted his notes. He seemed a little nonplussed.
He allowed three <i>coups</i> to go by without playing,
then on the fourth he rose again and built his maximums
about the thirty-two.</p>

<p>The croupiers seemed now to realize the dramatic value
of the situation. The spinner turned the wheel solemnly
as if it were a sacred rite; there was a tense moment, then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
a thrill ran through the crowd. In a voice that trembled
with chagrin the croupier called out:</p>


<p class="center">“<i>Trente deux, rouge pair et passe.</i>”</p>


<p>The old man had won. They paid him carefully and
ostentatiously. He gathered the notes in a worn leather
wallet, put his note-book and pencil back into his inner
pocket, rose and went away. A crowd followed him to the
door; inspectors gathered in groups and talked; directors
looked down from upper windows. Never had there been
such a sensational <i>début</i>.</p>

<p>“It’s fantastic,” said Hugh. “What with my own luck
and the professor’s you could bowl me over with a feather.
I want to indulge in hysterical laughter.”</p>

<p>“Better indulge in a brandy and soda,” said Mr. Gimp.
“I’ll see you home after.”</p>


<h4>2.</h4>

<p>Hugh found Margot embroidering a piece of white silk.
He marvelled at the delicate patience of her fingers.</p>

<p>“How jolly nice. What’s it for?”</p>

<p>“A blouse.”</p>

<p>“Good. You’ll look ripping in that.”</p>

<p>“You think so?... but it’s not for me.”</p>

<p>“Not for you!”</p>

<p>“No, you see, I’ve got some sewing to do. I might as
well. I have many spare hours each day. I am trying to
make a little money. It’s that nice <i>lingerie</i> shop near the
Hotel de Paris.”</p>

<p>“Good Heavens! And how much can you make at
that?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>“About five francs a day.”</p>

<p>“The deuce! What would you say if I told you that
to-day I had made fifty thousand?”</p>

<p>“You didn’t....”</p>

<p>“I did. It’s true I lost some of it afterwards. Ah! if
I’d only stopped in time. But I hung on to thirty
thousand.”</p>

<p>Eagerly he took out his sheaf of bills, and spread them
before her.</p>

<p>“There! I’ve fifty-five thousand, only five short of the
sixty.”</p>

<p>She looked frightened. She laid her hand on his.</p>

<p>“You’ll stop now. Please say you’ll stop.”</p>

<p>“No, I want sixty.”</p>

<p>She was silent, staring with troubled eyes before her,
her embroidery in her lap.</p>

<p>“Wake up,” he laughed. “You’re in a trance. What
are you thinking of,—your dowry?”</p>

<p>“No, of that rose-covered cottage.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that.... I say, you’re not going on with that
embroidery for the sake of making a measly five francs
a day?”</p>

<p>“Why not? It’s <i>clean</i> money.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think this money is clean?”</p>

<p>“No, I might have thought so once; but now ... I’ve
had my lesson.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t. It’s good enough for me. Why, it would
take me twenty years to save this money in the usual
way, and make a wreck of me at the same time. Life’s
too hard a battle. We can’t afford to choose our
weapons.”</p>

<p>A knock came at the door. It was Professor Durand.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
The old man had doffed his dignity, and was in slippers
and a dressing-gown. He bowed profoundly to Margot,
then he said to Hugh with a benevolent smile:</p>

<p>“I saw a light and thought you might have returned.
I am lonely. I wonder if you would care to come to my
den and smoke a pipe.”</p>

<p>Hugh followed the old man. The room surprised him.
There was a steel safe in one corner, a large cabinet, a
broad table covered with papers on which were algebraic
formulæ and geometrical figures.</p>

<p>“My workshop,” said the professor. “You saw me to-day?
Eh, what!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I congratulate you. You made a wonderful beginning.”</p>

<p>“No, I’m not satisfied. My timing was out. To-morrow
I’ll do better. I’ll only play once, but I’ll hit it.”</p>

<p>The professor spoke with such conviction that Hugh
was impressed.</p>

<p>“Extraordinary! A marvellous system. A discovery.”</p>

<p>“No, not a discovery, an invention. Just as logarithms
was an invention. But remember, it took me twenty years
to perfect it with all the resources of the higher mathematics
at my command. Twenty years! Come, take that
easy chair and light up. I’m going to give you a liqueur,
some very old Chartreuse; and we’ll talk.”</p>

<p>The professor, however, did most of the talking.
“Look,” said he, “at that stack of green volumes. You
have there the records of table number two for the past
thirteen years. I know that table like a living thing, and
yet I never saw it until to-day.”</p>

<p>“I suppose,” said Hugh, “that you base your system
on the law of average?”</p>

<p>The professor laughed tolerantly. “No, I don’t. Law<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
of average,—that is child’s talk to me. Of course every
table has its average, every wheel has its average, every
croupier, you, I; every <i>coup</i> that is played, is an average
with something that has gone before. Ah! these foolish
system-players with their talk of average and probability
and phenomenon. Why, every <i>coup</i> is a phenomenon as
regards something that has gone before. These things
don’t exist. They are sounding terms that mean nothing.
No, the trouble is that all these students of the laws of
chance go about it wrongly. Their systems are analytic,
mine is synthetic.”</p>

<p>“Do you claim that it is infallible?”</p>

<p>“By no means. You saw me fail to-day. What I do
claim is that I will succeed one time out of three.”</p>

<p>“That’s good enough.”</p>

<p>“Good enough to ruin the bank. I won’t stop till I
have taken a hundred millions from them. Don’t think I
want the money. I won’t touch one <i>sou</i> of it.”</p>

<p>“What will you do with it?”</p>

<p>“I am a patriot. My country is in trouble, in debt. I
will give it all to my country.”</p>

<p>“But why do you hate the Casino? Is it revenge?”</p>

<p>“No, retribution. My only son came here, played, lost
all ... he’s dead. Now you know the brutal truth. I
did not intend to tell any one. It’s painful even after
twenty years....”</p>

<p>“I understand....”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ll see me play to-morrow. I’ll take my seat
at three o’clock sharp.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be there.”</p>

<p>“I have them in the hollow of my hand. They don’t
suspect, they don’t dream. But to-morrow they will begin
to be uneasy, and as I close my hand to crush them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
they will be seized with panic, they will be filled with despair.
That will be the time I shall need some one to aid
me, to protect me, for I am old. I want a young man full
of intelligence, of courage, to guard me, and if need be,
to carry on my work. For instance,—<i>you!</i> Now do you
understand why I have asked you here to-night, why I
have told you all I have?... We’ll talk again of this.”</p>

<p>It was late when Hugh left the old man and returned to
his room. Margot was still bent over her embroidery.</p>

<p>“You’ll hurt your eyes,” he remonstrated; but she
shook her head obstinately.</p>

<p>“No, I won’t stop. I promised madame I’d finish this
for to-morrow.”</p>


<h4>3.</h4>

<p>When he arrived at the Casino the following afternoon,
he saw a crowd collected under the great rubber tree on
the edge of the “Cheese.” To his amazement he found
that it was gathered around Mrs. Fitzoswald and her
little brood. He heard exclamations such as: “The poor
dears! What a shame! Such a plucky little woman!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Fitz was excited. The light of battle was in her
eyes. Her cheeks were flushed. She proclaimed her
wrongs to the skies.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she cried, pointing to the Casino, “they ruined
him, the dirty rascals. They got all his money and now
they’ve thrown him into prison. A <i>mutilé</i> of the war; a
man who has given his leg for freedom, thrown into prison
like a criminal. But I’ll have justice. I’ll stand here
till they release him. Look at his innocent children, without
food, without shelter.”</p>

<p>At this the three little girls, aged seven, five and three,
began to weep and cling to her. Only the baby in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
arms of June Emslie was unmoved, laughing and chuckling
at the world.</p>

<p>June explained to Hugh what the trouble was. Major
Fitzoswald, it seemed, was expecting money from England
and had issued a cheque against it for the rent of his
apartment. Unfortunately the money was delayed and
the cheque was refused. The landlord appealed to the
authorities, who decided to make an example of the major.
There had been similar cases and they felt that the
citizens must be protected. So two very gorgeous gendarmes
had driven Major Fitzoswald to the Rock of
Monaco and presumably thrown him into its deepest dungeon.
Meanwhile the landlord had put his wife and children
on the street.</p>

<p>The English and American colony had been scandalized;
it was equivalent to a national insult. They had offered
to pay the amount of the cheque ten times over, but the
authorities were adamant.</p>

<p>“No,” they had said pompously; “the law must take its
course.”</p>

<p>Both the English and American Consuls had been appealed
to and had done their best to get the Major released
but without result. Public opinion was aroused;
prominent men had interviewed the administration, but
all to no purpose. The one-legged Major continued to
languish in his cell.</p>

<p>Then it was that Mrs. Fitz had come into action and,
planting herself with her brood in front of the grand entrance,
she cried her woes to the world. A sympathetic
crowd gathered, black looks were thrown at the temple
of chance, and its all-powerful administration were objurgated.
Every one was competing to aid the unfortunate
victims. Hugh saw Mr. Fetterstein, the multi-millionaire,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
descend the steps of the Hotel de Paris, and, to
the scandal of the flunkeys, take back with him the whole
bedraggled family for luncheon.</p>

<p>As Hugh entered the Casino he found Mr. Gimp in his
usual place between the two pillars at the entrance of the
atrium.</p>

<p>“Darned shame,” said Mr. Gimp. “Darned fine little
woman. Nice kids. I took ’em all to Quinto’s for dinner
last night. The whole thing’s a mistake. The Major’s
a gallant gentleman, but that bunch of Dago scalawags
that run this place are down on British and Americans.
They like our money, but that’s all. There’s no law.
The Casino gang runs the government. The whole population
live on the Casino like lice on a shark. The Prince
with his tin-pot army is in their pay. It’s mediæval, fantastic,
rotten. And you ask me, then, why do I stay here?
I can’t tell you. I just stay.”</p>

<p>Mr. Gimp inhaled his home-made cigarette and snorted
out a cloud of disgust.</p>

<p>“Say, I heard a good story of this place! A guy once
committed a crime. They ought to have guillotined him;
but as they didn’t have a guillotine, they decided to imprison
him for life. They threw him into a cell, but soon
it became such a nuisance to cook his food, that they
transferred him to a small hut near the frontier, hoping
he would escape. They had his meals sent in to him from
a neighbouring restaurant. But when the bills came in,
they drew a long face. He cost some, this prisoner. They
decided to pardon him, but he consulted a lawyer, and
found that his pardon was irregular. He refused to
accept it. Finally to get rid of him they had to pay him
a big sum to escape. That’s a sample of how things are
run here.... Look, there’s your friend the professor.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span></p>


<h4>4.</h4>

<p>The sensation in Casino circles caused by Mrs. Fitzoswald
was as nothing compared to the excitement
aroused by the second appearance of the professor. The
news ran like an electric thrill from one end of the Rooms
to the other. It communicated itself to the stolid blue-coated
lackeys; to the wary, black-coated officials with
their tiny cards, even to the callous croupiers themselves.</p>

<p>The professor stumped across the room leaning on his
cane; the old lady gave him her place as before. Every
one made way for him. He was the star player.
Again he went through the same programme with note-book
and pencil. He consulted the previous numbers
and quickly came to a decision. But instead of buying
chips as formerly, he handed the croupier the exact sum
to play his series of maximums. Then he announced his
number,—Five.</p>

<p>It took some time to place the money correctly. The
croupier did so with unction. His actions had all the
solemnity of a ceremonial. Finally every stake was correctly
placed. Excitement held the crowd spellbound.
With a determination at all cost to avoid the five, the
spinner threw the ball. It whirled around smoothly, then
dropped amid the diamond-shaped studs, dodged, rebounded,
zig-zagged, fell. A great shout arose. A sullen
voice announced: “<i>Cinq, rouge impair et manque.</i>”</p>

<p>Again the professor took up his gains and stumped his
way through the admiring crowd. Once more he had
gained over sixty thousand francs.</p>

<p>On the following day he made his appearance a little
after noon; the Rooms were at their quietest. On this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
occasion he seemed less sanguine of success. He made
two shots but in neither case did he strike the number.
However, his gains on his indirect stakes balanced his
losses, and he rose from the table in a few minutes neither
richer nor poorer. The Casino people breathed more
freely. They had been puzzled and a little worried. They
transferred their attention to the other and equally pressing
problems.</p>

<p>As time went on, more and more of the false chips were
being forced on the bank. Hugh felt the atmosphere of
suspicion daily increasing in intensity. Black-coated inspectors
and spies were everywhere. No one’s affairs
were private. The secret police were making desperate efforts
to discover the fabricators of the false counters, but
their efforts so far had resulted only in the conviction of
a croupier for petty pilfering. He had done it by pretending
to scratch his neck, and, in so doing, dropping
a louis down his collar. They did not put him in prison,
but hung a placard around his neck with I AM A THIEF
printed on it, and marched him around Monaco before
his friends and relations. Finally they kicked him across
the frontier.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fitzoswald, too, was giving them no small worry.
The little woman was conducting her campaign with skill
and tenacity. She was to be seen at all hours of the day
in front of the Casino, relating her misfortunes to a sympathizing
audience. Her children with tear-stained cheeks
ably supported her. People felt that it was unfair to
have their feelings harrowed when they came to enjoy
themselves. Complaint after complaint reached the administration,
which at last decided to take action. They
offered to pay her passage and that of her children to
England if she would go away at once.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>“What, go without my husband! Never! Release him
and pay his passage, too. That’s my ultimatum.”</p>

<p>The authorities refused. Negotiations were broken off.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the fourth day the professor again made his appearance
in the afternoon; and again repeated his performance
of the second day. The directors were in a
state of consternation. For the first time they began to
think that here was that inconceivable thing, a man with
an invincible system. All Monte Carlo was talking of it.
They awaited events with the greatest anxiety.</p>

THE COMPACT</h3>
</div>

<h4>1.</h4>

<p class="drop-cap2">AS the following day was Sunday the professor
did not play. Instead he went to early mass accompanied
by Margot, to whom he had taken a
fancy, and in the afternoon the two went for a walk together
in the direction of Menton. They asked Hugh to
accompany them but he refused.</p>

<p>To tell the truth he had other fish to fry. Since his
success, he had blossomed out in many ways. Some time
before he had been to a good tailor and had several suits
made. He had developed a fondness for the American
Bar of the Café de Paris, and had become increasingly
intimate with Mrs. Belmire.</p>

<p>At first he had merely admired her immensely; he was
flattered by her interest in him and had found a kind of
heady pleasure, like champagne, in her society. In the end
he had become really fascinated. Then one day something
happened that acted on him like a spur. He was walking
along the road to Beaulieu when a big carmine car swung
round a bend. He recognized Vulning at the wheel. He
thought the lady with him seemed familiar, but it was not
until she looked back laughingly and waved her hand that
he saw it was Mrs. Belmire.</p>

<p>If it had been any other man he would not have minded.
He knew she went about with Fetterstein and one or two
others. But Vulning!... He disliked Vulning. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
realized with a shock that he was jealously infatuated
with the lady.</p>

<p>On this particular Sunday afternoon he had arranged
to motor with her to Brodighera. He was happy in the
thought that he would have her all to himself for four
radiant hours.</p>

<p>They had not been long on the road when she said
sweetly:</p>

<p>“You poor boy! I believe we nearly ran you down the
other day. You looked ever so startled. Paul always
drives so recklessly. He gives me all kinds of thrills.”</p>

<p>“Why do you go out with him then?” Hugh snapped.</p>

<p>She looked at him curiously. There was a gleam of
amused satisfaction in her eye.</p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t I? I love thrills. Besides he’s an old
friend. Good gracious! I don’t believe you like him.”</p>

<p>“Why should I?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s not a bad sort. A bit blasé and all that sort
of thing. But ... well, you don’t know him.”</p>

<p>“We have met.”</p>

<p>“Have you really? I asked him after we had passed
if he knew you, and he said he didn’t. He meets so many
I suppose he forgot. He’s much sought after.”</p>

<p>Hugh grew more savage. Again he snapped. “I don’t
believe he’s the man a woman should be seen with often
if she values her reputation.”</p>

<p>“<i>Her reputation!</i>”</p>

<p>Hugh thought she was going to be angry. She stared
at him a moment, then suddenly said: “Oh you funny
boy! You nice boy! I like you so much for that. But
... I do believe you’re jealous of Paul Vulning.”</p>

<p>“Why should I be?”</p>

<p>“Because he’s so like you. You’ve got the same regular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
features, the same fair hair. You’re both tall and
rather slight. But you needn’t resent all that. Paul is
a rather soiled man of the world; you are a nice clean boy
who might be fresh from Oxford.”</p>

<p>She looked at him thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“I’d like to keep you as you are, but it might be better
for yourself if you were a little more sophisticated. I
have half a mind to take you in hand, to educate you in
the ways of the world. May I?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you mean.”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t think you would. You are a little—may
I say it?—naïve sometimes.... I say, don’t you admire
my new blouse? I just got it this morning. The embroidery’s
so pretty, I think.”</p>

<p>Something in the design struck Hugh as familiar. Yes,
it was the work he had seen Margot sitting up so late
to finish.</p>

<p>“You look so serious. Don’t you like it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s lovely.”</p>

<p>“I think so too. By the way, why don’t you begin to
gamble again? You play so well and you are so lucky.
You must join the Club. You might make lots of money.
Talking about horrid money reminds me ... mine hasn’t
arrived and I’m rather low again. You may lend me another
<i>mille</i> if you like.”</p>

<p>On the way back they overtook an old man and a girl.
It was Margot and the professor. Margot’s arms were
full of flowers. Hugh waved to them, and the professor
waved back. Margot only stared. Hugh felt uncomfortable.
He was sorry he had encountered them.</p>

<p>When he reached home the room was bright with blossoms.
Margot was very quiet. She did not refer to their
meeting and neither did he. But for some reason for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
which he could not account, he did not care to meet her
eyes.</p>


<h4>2.</h4>

<p>On his way to the Casino, the next day, he missed the
usual crowd at the edge of the “Cheese,” and hunting up
Mr. Tope inquired after Mrs. Fitzoswald.</p>

<p>“Haven’t you heard? The Casino capitulated. They
had the Major released and paid the fares of the whole
family to England. They all went off this morning.”</p>

<p>“And June Emslie?”</p>

<p>“I believe she got a job as a nurse girl or something
with a family in Menton.”</p>

<p>“Poor girl!”</p>

<p>“I say, let me tell you once more, there’s the very wife
for a lad like you. Why don’t you marry her? Just
as sweet as a rose, and badly up against it.”</p>

<p>Hugh laughed and was glad of the diversion caused by
the entrance of the Calderbrooks.</p>

<p>“Hullo! They’ve come back. I’ve missed them for
some time,” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“They were lying low. No money! Now they’ve got
out some more and are starting in again. I’m told they’ve
sold or mortgaged their property in England and taken
an apartment here. In a few years’ time they will be just
like all the other derelicts, haunting the Casino with no
money to play, seedy, down at heel, sodden. You know
the sort. Look around; you’ll see enough of ’em.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Calderbrook with a resolute look, was stalking in
front; the girl Alicia, tall and slender, followed; the father
with his wistful blue eye and drooping grey moustache
trailed after them.</p>

<p>Hugh had heard that Alicia had been engaged to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
young ex-aviator who had bought a ranch in Alberta. She
had expected to have joined him as soon as possible, but
Monte Carlo had thrown its spell over her. The thought
of a lonely ranch on the prairie became unbearable and
she broke off the engagement. She would probably never
have another chance to marry.</p>

<p>To Hugh’s surprise he did not find MacTaggart in his
usual place under the Three Graces, but instead, in his
seat was Mr. Gimp.</p>

<p>“Yep,” said Mr. Gimp, sourly, “I’m old Mac’s deputy.
Hate like hell to do this but he’s sick. He was getting
out of bed, wanted to crawl down anyway, hated to lose
his records. I made him go back and told him I’d take
his place. It’s all damned rot, you know. I might as well
put down any old numbers and give them to him. It
would be the same in the end. Howsoever, I’m conscientious.”</p>

<p>“Is he very sick?”</p>

<p>“Nerves mostly. The success of your old friend, the
professor, gave him a nasty jar. Kind o’ destroyed his
confidence in his own system. Say, you want to tell the
old boy to be careful. He was in this morning early,
played five shots, and got the bulls-eye twice. Carried off
over a hundred thousand francs.”</p>

<p>“Why should he be careful?”</p>

<p>“Because the Casino folks ain’t goin’ to stand that
sort o’ thing indefinitely. They’re gettin’ scared; and believe
me, when they get scared they’ll get desperate. It
stands to reason, they ain’t goin’ to let themselves be
ruined if they can help it. The old fellow seems to have
some way of spotting a winner, or getting so close to it
he breaks even. It’s plain now it ain’t all accident. Well,
if he can make fifty thousand a day he can just as well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
make two hundred thousand ... and then let him look
out.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Why, if he went on, they’d just have to close their
doors. Not only the Casino would be ruined but the Principality.
D’ye think they’re goin’ to stand for that?”</p>

<p>“They could expel him.”</p>

<p>“What good would that do? He could put some one
else on. No, the only way would be to suppress both him
and his system; and believe me, they won’t stick at half
measures to do it. I don’t say as they’ll stoop to crime;
but there’s men in their pay as ain’t so scrupulous.
There’s the existence of the whole community at stake.
Accidents can happen. What’s a man’s life compared
with the ruin of twenty thousand people? Believe me, the
professor’s playin’ a dangerous game.”</p>

<p>Hugh left Mr. Gimp sitting on one of the side benches
still sourly taking down the hated numbers. He mooned
round the rooms, thinking more of Mrs. Belmire than of
the play. She had called him <i>naïve</i>; that had hurt his
vanity. Was he naïve?</p>

<p>Mrs. Belmire had urged him to go on gambling, but he
had baulked. Of course, she thought he had plenty of
money, and that his winnings at roulette meant little to
him. On the contrary they meant so much to him that he
was determined to hold on to them at all costs. Of his
fifty-five thousand five had already melted away. He had
loaned her two and had spent another two on clothes.
Perhaps it was the lesson that poverty had taught him in
his youth, perhaps it was due to his Scottish ancestry,
but he had a curious streak of prudence in him. He had
deposited fifty thousand francs in the bank and was determined
not to touch it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>Since his last spectacular performance at the tables,
a reaction had set in. He found himself almost in the
same state of indifference that he had been before he had
begun to play. His sudden passion for gambling seemed
to have spent itself, and he wondered how he could ever
have been so obsessed.</p>

<p>Fifty thousand francs! Yes, he had been miraculously
lucky. It seemed like providence. He would buy a car
and a cottage, and spend his spare time in painting. As
for Mrs. Belmire, he would tell her just how matters
stood. But not just yet. Perhaps he would allow her
to educate him a little first. No more roulette though;
not even for tobacco money. No opportunities, however
good, would tempt him. Confound Mrs. Belmire! She
had said that she was dining that evening with Paul
Vulning. She had made a point of telling him about it,
he believed.</p>


<h4>3.</h4>

<p>He spent three days painting at Cap Ferrat. He
started early each morning and returned late, drunk with
fresh air and sunshine. Then on the fourth day he rested
and found his way in due course to the Casino. Mr.
Gimp was still replacing MacTaggart.</p>

<p>“I expect Mac will be on deck again to-morrow,” Mr.
Gimp said in response to his inquiry. “He can’t afford
to lie off much longer. You know he’s working on a mere
two or three hundred francs of capital. He lives on fifteen
francs a day. If he don’t make ’em, he goes hungry.
I know for a fact, lots of nights, he makes a supper of
dry bread. That’s what’s killing him,—the worry of
making his day. If he could afford to play with higher
stakes, say louis instead of five franc pieces, it would be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
different. He’s got all kinds of faith in his system; sure
there’s a fortune in it.”</p>

<p>“I had no idea he was so short.”</p>

<p>“Oh, there’s lots like that,—a good front and behind
it starvation.... Just look at that Dago Castelli,—there’s
a dashing, sporty player if you like.”</p>

<p>The handsome Italian was playing a brilliant <i>paroli</i>
game. He played between three tables, putting a louis
on each of the simple chances. If they were swept away
he replaced them; if they won he left them on with
the louis of gain. He continued to leave on stake and
gains for six wins, then he took them up. This did not
occur very often; but when it did it netted him thirty-two
louis. The game was an unusual one, lively, easy to
play, and interesting. Castelli always played this same
game, and frequently with great success. That day, however,
runs of six were rare and his louis were being swept
away like leaves before the wind.</p>

<p>Hugh persisted in his decision not to play. He saw
chance after chance to win, but let them go by. He was
finished. He turned from the game and watched the players.
The woman in grey came and went, always throwing
a louis on number one. He saw her play several times at
three different tables but without success. After looking
on awhile, she went slowly away. The latest rumour he
had heard concerning her was that she was a celebrated
actress who had recently been acquitted of a case of <i>crime
passionel</i>.</p>

<p>As he was wondering who she really was, a curious conversation
attracted his attention. A big, ruddy Englishman
was talking to a small shabby individual with a
blotched face and gold-rimmed spectacles. The little man
was saying:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>“In six weeks from to-day you will pay me fifteen thousand
francs. To-day I give you thirteen thousand, five
hundred. That is understood, is it not?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is understood.”</p>

<p>“But what about exchange? If the franc goes down
in value, you will have gained. In that case you will pay
me the difference. Is that understood?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is understood.”</p>

<p>The little man took from his note-book a prepared slip
of paper and the Englishman signed it with a fountain
pen. The little man counted out thirteen thousand five
hundred francs in notes and his companion took them,
and threw a thousand on the first table. He lost, and
without trying to regain them went off to the private
rooms.</p>

<p>Hugh decided to go home. As he was crossing the
“Hall of Light,” he saw Castelli sauntering in front of
him. What a handsome chap that Italian was. What a
favourite he must be with women. He was speaking to
one now.... No, he had turned and was in conversation
with the chief inspector of the Rooms. After a moment
they disappeared together through one of the glass doors
that works with a hidden catch.</p>

<p>On all sides Hugh heard wonderful accounts of the
professor. For three days the old man had won seventy
thousand francs a day. Half the profits of the Casino
were going into his pocket. It was said the administration
was becoming desperate.</p>


<h4>4.</h4>

<p>Mr. Jarvis Tope had a source of secret information.
His landlord was a retired croupier and the two were excellent
friends. In this way he came to know many matters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
not revealed to the public, and he was very discreet
about disseminating his information.</p>

<p>“By the way,” he said to Hugh, “you’ve heard that a
gang are passing counterfeit louis in Casino money?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, they’ve got one of them at least. In his room
in Nice they found a suit-case full of it. You’ve probably
seen the chap.”</p>

<p>“Who.”</p>

<p>“His name is Castelli....”</p>

<p>“No!”</p>

<p>“Yes. They got him two days ago, but they have been
watching him for weeks. Some very sharp person on the
Casino detective staff noticed that he seemed to have an
inexhaustible supply of louis. That put them on the track.
They’ve expelled him from the Principality. Well, that’s
one worry off their shoulders. Their other one is your
old friend, the professor. There they’ve got a tough nut
to crack, I fear.”</p>

<p>“Do you think they’ll crack it?”</p>

<p>“Think! I know. A word in your ear. You tell the
old chap to get out. Get him away in a car, far and fast.
They’ve simply got to get that system, to get <i>him</i>. You
understand. If they wish to save themselves from ruin,
neither he nor his system must continue to exist. They’re
only waiting now to make sure he’s got them. They can’t
buy him off. They can’t let him escape. I say, I wouldn’t
be in that old man’s shoes for all the money he’s made.
Sounds melodramatic, I know. You think I exaggerate.
You don’t know this place. Get him away, I say. Lose
no time. Don’t laugh. <i>I know.</i>”</p>

<p>Hugh was so disturbed that he knocked that night on
the old man’s door.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>“Who’s there?”</p>

<p>“Your neighbour.”</p>

<p>There was a turning of locks and the professor appeared.
He had been working out his play for the next
day.</p>

<p>“Come in. Do you know I was just coming to see you.
I want to enter into an arrangement with you.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I want protection. Twice I believe my life to have
been attempted. Twice I have nearly been run down by
a car. The first time I thought it was accidental, but
I noticed it was the same car....”</p>

<p>“You must be mistaken.”</p>

<p>“I hope so. In any case I want you to accompany me
to the Casino and back, and to stay with me when I play.
I’ll pay you anything you like. A thousand francs a day
if you agree.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want pay. I’ll be glad to help you.”</p>

<p>“Ah, I knew I could count on you. But look here,
young man, I warn you it’s dangerous.”</p>

<p>“All right. But for your own sake, hadn’t you better
try to compromise with them?”</p>

<p>“Never. They’ve already approached me. They said
they didn’t believe in my system, but were willing to buy
it. They offered me ten million francs in Casino stock.
I told them, if they offered me a hundred million, I would
refuse. They advised me to reconsider my decision. They
were very courteous, said they were acting in the public
interest and so on. Oh, they talked smoothly enough, but
I could see the menace behind.... Look here!”</p>

<p>The professor went to the safe, twirled the combination,
opened the heavy door and took out a leather bound
folio.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>“Here it is, the condensed result of all my labours, the
explanation of my system. It is all in cypher. I want
you to learn the six different cyphers I use.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because, if anything should happen to me, I want you
to avenge me. All you have to do is to publish this to
the world. Their ruin will be complete. Hush!” The
Professor went quickly to the door and threw it open.
No one was there.</p>

<p>“I’m getting so nervous. It seems to me I’m watched
all the time. You’ll promise, won’t you? You’ll be my
protector, my assistant, my partner? You hesitate. Are
you afraid?”</p>

<p>“Afraid! no.”</p>

<p>“All right. Will you?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Good. Your hand on it. To-morrow we’ll begin.”</p>

PROSPEROUS DAYS</h3>
</div>

<h4>1.</h4>

<p class="drop-cap">“BY Goad!” said MacTaggart, sipping his second
whiskey, “the auld man’s a wizard. He’s got me
fair bamboozilt.”</p>

<p>It was evening, and he and Hugh were sitting in the
Café de Paris.</p>

<p>“I thocht I knew something o’ roulette, but noo I maun
jist go back tae Strathbungo and play dominoes. And
you, young man, wi’ that canny wee smile on yer gub,—I’m
thinkin’ ye ken mair aboot it than ye want tae tell.”</p>

<p>Hugh shook his head.</p>

<p>“No, I can’t grasp it. And yet I’m with the old man
every day. The scientific explanation of it’s beyond me.
A mathematical mystery. Your system and all the others
are based on the laws of average, the equilibrium. It’s a
calculation of chances, of probabilities. So far so good!
The law of average does exist. It’s all rot to say that
the <i>coup</i> that’s gone has no influence on the one that is
to come. It has. It’s true that the slots are all the same
size and so each has an equal claim to the ball, but it is
because of this equal chance that they will each receive
it an equal number of times. I’ve seen a number come up
three times in succession, yet I wouldn’t hesitate to bet
thirty-five to one, in thousands, that it won’t come up a
fourth time. Mechanically, maybe it has an equal chance
with the others, but by the law of average, no.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>“That’s elementary,” said MacTaggart.</p>

<p>“Yes, but it’s as deep as the most of us get. We’re all
in the kindergarten class. We grope vaguely. We
fumble with probabilities. As far as we go we are
right; but we don’t go far enough. We reach a point
where our system breaks down. The law of average is
too big for us to compress into a formula. In its larger
workings it eludes us; we cannot regulate it. Our observations
of it are too limited.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got a record of over two hundred thousand consecutive
<i>coups</i>,” said MacTaggart.</p>

<p>“The professor has a record of over two million. The
amount of work he has done is colossal. He has studied
the numbers in their relation to one another; he has classified,
co-ordinated, condensed. His system is one of correspondence
and elimination. He has used the resources
of mathematics to put it on a working basis. He has
gone above and behind all the rest of us. His comprehension
is larger; he has grasped the wider workings of the
law of average. He has narrowed down and focussed the
probability, and reduced the phenomena by the magnitude
of his calculations to a minimum. The day of the year
and the hour of the day has a bearing on the application
of his system. That red note-book of his is full of algebraic
formula. By looking at the last dozen numbers that
have come up and referring to his formulæ, he has a hint
how to play. But even then he is never quite sure. Sometimes
he is only within eight numbers, sometimes within
four. But that’s good enough. He has been lucky in
hitting the precise number one time out of three; but
scientifically speaking he considers he ought to strike it
only one time out of five.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>“I’ve seen him strike it every day for the last month.
He must hae averaged over sixty thoosand francs a day,
I’m thinkin’. I expect the members o’ the board are losin’
lots o’ sleep them days. It’s no’ a question of him winnin’,
but how much is he goin’ tae win. They’ve got
old Bob Bender watchin’ him every time he plays. If it
wisna that you were everlastingly doin’ the watch dog
some one would get a graup o’ that wee book he’s forever
keekin intae. Though I don’t suppose they’d mak’
much o’ it, wi’ a’ thae queer, crabbed letters an’ figures.
I’m sure they’d be gled tae gi’ him a year’s profits
if he’d stop. Aye, or pay a fortune tae any one that wad
stop him. But then he’s got you for a bodyguard.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he never goes out without me.”</p>

<p>“Aye, ye’re a cautious young man. I’m sometimes
thinkin’ ye’ve got a touch o’ the Scot in ye. I hope ye’ve
no’ been an’ squandert that money ye were sae lucky as tae
win?”</p>

<p>“No, the most of it’s in the bank. I won’t touch it for
gambling purposes. In fact, I think I’ve finished.”</p>

<p>“I’m wishin’ I wis masel’. I’m sick o’ the place, but I
must stay until I mak’ enough to go home no’ lookin’ like
a tramp. Ye ken I still believe in ma system.”</p>

<p>“I tell you what,” said Hugh, “why don’t you play with
a bigger unit? You play with five franc stakes and you
make from four to eight pieces every day. Why not increase
your unit to a hundred francs, and then you’ll
make from four to eight hundred francs a day.”</p>

<p>“I hav’ nae the capital.”</p>

<p>“Suppose I lend you a thousand francs.”</p>

<p>“I micht lose it.”</p>

<p>“I tell you.... You play with my thousand francs,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
playing hundred franc stakes, and I’ll take the risk of
you losing. When you win you can pay me a quarter of
your gains.”</p>

<p>“All right. That’s fair enough. I’ll start to-morrow
if ye like.”</p>

<p>Hugh gave MacTaggart a <i>mille</i> note, and every evening
MacTaggart hunted him up and handed over a
hundred and sometimes two hundred francs.</p>


<h4>2.</h4>

<p>For weeks the great system of the professor had been
successful. His bank book showed a credit of over two
million francs. Every day accompanied by Hugh, he
made his triumphal entry into the Casino surrounded by
an excited and admiring throng. He made no other public
appearance and was a storm centre of curiosity. Hugh
acted as the old man’s manager and saw to it that his
mystery was preserved. He interviewed reporters, and
kept off the curious; for the professor was fast becoming
a character of international fame. The great press
agencies chronicled his success; the great dailies paragraphed
him; his portrait graced the picture page of the
<i>Daily Mail</i>. There were articles about him in the illustrated
weeklies; and even the monthly journals devoted
to science began to consider him seriously. He and
Hugh were snapshotted a dozen times a day. All the well-known
roulette players, Speranza, Dr. Ludus, Max Imum
and Silas Doolittle wrote long letters to the papers diagnosing
his famous system. Never had the Casino had such
advertising—yet it was costing them too much.</p>

<p>The old man never broke the bank. There was nothing
sensational about his play. It was almost monotonous in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
its certitude; it had the air even of a commercial transaction
in which he had come to collect a daily debt. It was
this cold-blooded, business-like precision that alarmed
them. It was almost cynical; it seemed to say: “Look
out. I’m letting you off easy now, but when I proceed
to tighten up the cinch, God help you.”</p>

<p>An imaginative reporter had said that Hugh was the
professor’s nephew, and they both agreed to adopt this
suggestion. Indeed, as time went on, Hugh himself began
to think of the old man as a real uncle. At times it
seemed almost impossible that they were not related.</p>

<p>Hugh had taken to smoking excellent cigars. Why not?
MacTaggart was turning in over a thousand a week. He
felt some compunction in accepting this; but MacTaggart
was making three times as much for himself, and was more
than satisfied. He could well afford to be extravagant in
other directions as well. There was Mrs. Belmire, for instance.
He took her to dinner a great deal, and out motoring
as well. Apart from that he and Margot still
lived in the same simple way.</p>

<p>One morning as Hugh sat smoking in the professor’s
den, he observed the old man closely.</p>

<p>“He’s easily good for another ten years,” he thought.
“Looks rather like Karl Marx, burly shoulders, clear,
shrewd eyes. A sane man except for his fanatic obsession
to down the Casino.”</p>

<p>The professor interrupted his reflections by saying:</p>

<p>“My boy, I’ve come to a great decision.” He paused
impressively. “I’m an old man, and I am afraid that
death may come on me unawares, my life work unfinished.
I have decided that you are to carry it on. You shall
begin where I leave off. I am going to instruct you in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
system. You shall take the avenging sword from my
failing grasp.”</p>

<p>Hugh made a gesture of protest. “I say, professor, it’s
awfully good of you. I assure you I’m humbly grateful;
but really I’m quite unworthy.”</p>

<p>“I know of no one so worthy.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, the honour’s too great. Besides, I’ve made up
my mind never to play again. A resolution’s a resolution,
you know.”</p>

<p>“I know. You have force of will. But think....
You are not playing for yourself but for humanity.
Yours will be a mission, the ridding society of a dangerous
pest. In destroying the Casino you will be God’s
avenger.”</p>

<p>“But, professor, I’m just a common ordinary sort of
chap. I don’t want to be anybody’s avenger. As for the
Casino, I don’t bear it any ill will. If I had lost, perhaps
I might, but it has treated me well. Of course, I know it’s
a plague spot, a menace to mankind and all that sort of
thing, but that’s none of my business as far as I can
see.”</p>

<p>The professor looked both grieved and shocked. “But
don’t you want to be a benefactor to mankind? Don’t
you want to fulfil a great destiny, to be a reformer, the
leader of a new crusade?”</p>

<p>“No, professor, I admit with shame I don’t want to be
any of those things. All I want is to live a quiet life and
make a comfortable living. There’s a cottage with a
garden and a second-hand Panhard I have my eye on.
Between them I can rub along. Then on off days, I’ll
paint. I’ve just begun to get the feeling of the place,
and I think I can do good work. But there! You’re not
an artist. You won’t understand.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>The professor seemed quite crushed. He sat silent and
thoughtful. Finally he said:</p>

<p>“No, I’m not an artist. I’m a man of science, and for
that reason I don’t want to see my life work lost to the
world. Well then, if you refuse to be my disciple, will
you be my trustee? You refuse to play for me,—will you
see that the system is published after my death? It is a
contribution to science; at the same time by its divination
of the laws of chance, it will destroy the spirit of
gambling. Not only the Casino of Monte Carlo, but
gambling institutions all over the world will fall. The Casino
is only an item in my programme. I destroy chance;
I replace it with certitude. My work is not complete, but
others will follow. They will perfect it. Will you then do
this much for me? Will you see my great work in print?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll do that. I promise. But hang it all, professor,
you’ve got another thirty years to live.”</p>

<p>“One never knows. There have been no attempts on
my life lately, but I must take no chances. I will begin
now and teach you all there is to know.”</p>

<p>The professor opened his safe and took from it a thick
folio bound in limp leather.</p>

<p>“<i>Voila!</i> My treatise. It’s all there, the condensed result
of the labour of thirty years. The red note-book contains
the application of my system to roulette; but in this
folio is the result of all my researches, the scientific explanation
of the invention by which I annihilate chance.
Look at it.”</p>

<p>“But it’s all in cypher.”</p>

<p>“Yes, all. Not one cypher but many. For the alphabet
alone I have three different sets of characters; for
the figures, six. You will have to learn over a hundred
symbols before you can translate this. And these must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
not be put on paper; they must be carried in the head. I
will teach them to you but you must promise never to write
them. I have protected myself well. Without the cypher
keys that folio is valueless.”</p>

<p>So Hugh spent the next few days committing to memory
the hundred odd cypher characters of the professor’s
great discovery.</p>


<h4>3.</h4>

<p>When he was not engaged with the professor, he occupied
most of his time dangling after Mrs. Belmire. She
had definitely attached him to her train of admirers and
he had fallen in line, not without a certain ill grace. The
life she led was at variance with his tastes; and while he
submitted to her charm, he was constantly on the point of
rebellion. He was like a man who chafes at his chains
but cannot break them. He resented the easy way in
which she took his homage for granted. There were moments
when he almost hated her. What rotten luck to fall
in love with a woman so far beyond and above him! If it
had only been June Emslie, or even Margot. But who
can help these things? In the end he decided to let himself
drift,—with a certain regard to the direction of his
drifting.</p>

<p>Perhaps Paul Vulning was to some extent responsible
for his subjection. He detested the man cordially and was
jealous of the friendship between him and Mrs. Belmire.
When he saw them together he was possessed by an irresponsible
rage and tortured by all sorts of jealous
imaginings. If it had only been Fetterstein or the old
General.... But Vulning!</p>

<p>She had not borrowed any money from him lately, although
she was always urging him to play again. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
last time she had borrowed from him had set him thinking.
He had suffered so much from the want of money
that now he was painfully aware of its value. At all costs
he was determined to hang on to his fifty thousand francs.
He would lend her another thousand but no more. That
was the breaking point, he told himself.</p>

<p>“In any case,” he thought, “I have only to tell her my
position and she’ll chuck me ignominiously. She thinks
I’m a rich somebody. When she learns I’m a poor
nobody then.... But I won’t tell her yet awhile. I enjoy
very much being with her, and undoubtedly I am learning
a good deal from her. ‘Sophisticating me,’ she calls
it. Well, I suppose that sort of thing is part of a chap’s
education. I will have to regard it as a return for the
money I have lent her, and which, poor thing, I am sure
she will never return. Confound the woman! I don’t
know what’s got into me. I can’t get her out of my head.”</p>

<p>One day he would vow he was finished with her, the next
he would be crazy to see her again. Even when he
was with her, his irritation sometimes drove him to the
point of rebellion. For instance, there was the evening
that they had supper at the High Life.</p>

<p>It was she who had suggested that they go there, and
rather gloomily he had complied. They had gone first to
the Casino and spent some time in the private room, for
Mrs. Belmire disdained the ordinary one. After watching
the play for awhile she had suggested:</p>

<p>“Why don’t you try your luck? It’s stupid to look on
and not risk anything.”</p>

<p>“No, thanks, I don’t care to.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come on. You always win. Even if you lose, what
do a few thousands matter to you when you have won
so enormously? Even I saw you.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>He sighed gloomily.</p>

<p>“Yes, you saw me win but—you didn’t see me lose.”</p>

<p>“Of course, poor boy, I know one can’t always win. If
you won’t play, give me some money and I’ll play for you.”</p>

<p>He took a hundred franc note from his pocket and
handed it to her. She looked at it with a surprised contempt
that nettled him. As if it were dirt she threw it on
the first table. Of course it was swept away.</p>

<p>“There!” she said pettishly, “that’s gone. Well, it’s
no use staying here if we don’t play. It’s tiresome. Let’s
go where there’s music and dancing.”</p>

<p>They went to the High Life, a place he disliked. It
had a rakehell atmosphere, and suggested debauch. He
also resented the obvious fact that she was quite at home
there.</p>

<p>“Faugh! a den of gilded corruption!” he was thinking,
when an insinuating head-waiter presented a wine card
and suggested a certain expensive brand of champagne.</p>

<p>“I know it’s the kind madam prefers,” he murmured.</p>

<p>“Do order a bottle,” said Mrs. Belmire carelessly.</p>

<p>Hugh ordered, and at her further suggestion he demanded
a <i>homard American</i>; the bill came to two hundred
francs. He was annoyed.</p>

<p>“Damned robbers,” he thought. “Well, they won’t get
ahead of me on the champagne. I’ll finish the bottle.”</p>

<p>As he drank the place became more and more cheerful.
He felt very strong and very playful. He clutched Mrs.
Belmire’s arm; once even he pinched her cheek and called
her Marion. She looked at him curiously. There is no
saying to what further indiscretions his exhilaration
might have prompted him, had not there at that moment
occurred the episode of the <i>Nouveau Riche</i> and the Sick
Soldier.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span></p>


<h4>4.</h4>

<p>The <i>Nouveau Riche</i> was all a <i>nouveau riche</i> should be,
big, bloated and boastful. He had been a cobbler before
the war, but had made a fortune in shoe contracts. The
Soldier should never have been there at all. Some friends,
however, had dragged him in; and he sat looking thin,
pale, and wretchedly out of place.</p>

<p>The <i>Nouveau Riche</i> was playfully emptying a bottle of
champagne over a small palm tree. The manager expostulated.
It was doubtful if palms, however thirsty,
would appreciate the virtue of Chateau Margaux, but the
<i>Nouveau Riche</i> waved him aside.</p>

<p>“Put your damned palm on the bill,” he said, “and
bring me a fresh bottle.” He was proceeding to pour this,
too, on the unfortunate plant when the Sick Soldier
sprang up.</p>

<p>“I’ve had enough,” he cried, and his black eyes
flashed in his white face. He wrenched the bottle from
the man’s hand. “You swine, you! Where I come from
there are men who would give their heart’s blood for a
mouthful of that wine you’re wasting like filthy water.”</p>

<p>The <i>Nouveau Riche</i> got purple in the face; the Soldier
was gripping the loose flesh of his throat and pouring the
rest of the champagne over his head.</p>

<p>“Here you sit and swill and guzzle,” he went on, “while
my comrades out there in the desert are dying from hunger
and thirst. In Syria.... Yes, I come from Syria where
we crawled on our bellies on the sand, crawled to the water
tanks to steal a few precious drops and were shot for it
like mad dogs. We buried a dead horse and dug it up a
week later and ate it. Half of us died in agony, the rest
are wrecks—like me. And now when I see a pig like you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
squandering and wasting, and think of my pals out there,
suffering, starving, panting with thirst, I tell you it makes
me sick.... Oh, if I only had you out there, you rotten
hog....”</p>

<p>There seemed every prospect of a row, but the Man
from Syria suddenly collapsed and his friends led him
away.</p>

<p>“This is a beastly hole,” said Hugh abruptly. “Let’s
get out of it.”</p>

<p>There was something hard and cynical in Mrs. Belmire’s
laugh as she replied: “Why should we? I think
it’s rather amusing.”</p>

<p>“Amusing!” he retorted savagely. “You seem to think
of nothing but being amused. One would think you lived
for amusement.”</p>

<p>“Why, so I do, I believe. What better is there to live
for? What do you live for?”</p>

<p>As he could not think of any worthy object that inspired
his life he did not reply, and they sat in silence.
Their drive home was silent also, but at the door of the
Pension Pizzicato she held his hand.</p>

<p>“We haven’t quarrelled, have we?”</p>

<p>“No, why?”</p>

<p>“You’re so queer. Not a bit nice. I say, won’t you
come up to my room and smoke a cigarette? It’s so late
we can slip upstairs without meeting any one.”</p>

<p>An instinct of danger warned him. At the moment,
too, she really repelled him.</p>

<p>“No, I’m tired. I want to go home.”</p>

<p>But she still held his hand with a soft pressure.</p>

<p>“Can’t I coax you? Please come. There’s something
very important I want to talk to you about.”</p>

<p>“What is it? Can’t you tell me here?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>“Yes, but ... I was thinking about that man who
spilled the champagne. Of course, he was an awful brute,
but what heaps of money he must have. What a nuisance
money is! It’s so sordid and yet one’s just got to have
it.”</p>

<p>He knew what was coming.</p>

<p>“I say, you’re the best pal I’ve got here. I don’t know
what I’d do without you. I’m in awful difficulties. Debts
all round. Horrid people keep pressing me to pay their
wretched bills. Oh, I’m only a lonely, unprotected
woman....”</p>

<p>Here Mrs. Belmire began to cry.</p>

<p>“Can’t you lend me ten thousand francs, dear boy?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>He was surprised at the explosive vehemence of his
tone. The lady was even more surprised. Her tears
ceased suddenly. With a kind of pained dignity she drew
herself up.</p>

<p>“Good-night,” she said icily and then turning sharply,
left him alone with the sea and the stars.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER TWO<br />


A BURGLAR AND A ROW</h3>
</div>

<h4>1.</h4>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN he got home he found Margot was still up.
She was sewing under the lamp-glow, her coiled
mass of hair a bright gold as she bent over her
work, her face pale but full of patient sweetness. As
Hugh stood there in his evening dress, flushed and reeking
of wine, the eyes she raised to him were tired and sad.</p>

<p>Since the time she had met him with Mrs. Belmire there
had been a change in her manner towards him. No longer
did she make timid overtures of friendship, no longer tell
him of the day’s doings. She had ceased to laugh and
sing, and had become very quiet and reserved. She toiled
continually with her needle.</p>

<p>It always irritated him to see her working so hard; and
to-night, being in a bad humour, he said crossly: “Not in
bed yet! You’ll hurt your eyes, you know.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry. I’m just going. I stayed up because I
wanted to see you about something.”</p>

<p>“Yes, what?”</p>

<p>“I’ve managed to make two hundred francs by my sewing.
I don’t want to be a burden on you any longer. I’m
going back to Paris to work in an <i>atelier</i>. I’m going to-morrow
morning.”</p>

<p>He was quite taken aback. He stared for a moment;
then a steady, serious look came into his eyes. Going
forward he took her hand firmly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>“Do you really mean that?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I’ve been planning it for some time.”</p>

<p>“And you haven’t said anything.”</p>

<p>“I scarcely ever see you now. You’re so busy during
the day and get home so late at night.”</p>

<p>He hesitated, staring thoughtfully at the lamp flame.
His emotions were conflicting. Here was a chance to free
himself from all responsibility regarding her. Sooner or
later the separation would have to come, why not now
while she was reconciled to it? Quickly he made up his
mind.</p>

<p>“Look here, Margot, don’t go ... not just yet. Stay
at least a little while longer. I’ve got so used to you. I’ll
miss you awfully. Please stay, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“But what’s the good of staying?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I just feel I can’t let you go. I know
I’m asking a selfish thing, but please don’t leave me
just yet.”</p>

<p>“Very well.”</p>

<p>“You’ll stay? Thank you. You’re a good little pal.
The best of the lot. Good-night....”</p>

<p>The following day his mood changed. His mind was
full of Mrs. Belmire again. After all, he thought, he had
been rather rough. He would lend her the money; he
would seek her out that very afternoon.</p>

<p>Then an event occurred that changed the whole current
of his thoughts.</p>


<h4>2.</h4>

<p>For two days Monte Carlo had been at the mercy of
the Mistral. Many strange ships were sheltering in the
narrow harbour that with its concrete arms fended back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
the savage seas; the palms in the gardens lashed furiously
and the air was full of flying splinters.</p>

<p>All that morning the sky had been gloomy and towards
noon the clouds over the Tête du Chien deepened to a
purple black. The mountain seemed to cast a sinister
shadow over the Condamine, and the pink roofs darkened
to a dull crimson. Hugh suggested to the professor that
they had better stay at home, but the old man insisted
upon going to the Rooms. As they left the house they
heard the first ominous growl of the thunder. Hugh
wanted to take a carriage but again his companion
refused.</p>

<p>“No,” he said, “the walk to and from the Casino is the
only exercise I get since that balcony business.”</p>

<p>The business of the balcony had been a bad one. Across
the front of the house, just outside their windows, ran a
flimsy wooden balcony, with a division of lattice work between
each room. The professor used to march up and
down his portion of the balcony, while Hugh and Margot
often sat in theirs.</p>

<p>One Sunday evening they were all on the balcony when
they heard a crack, followed by a rending crash. As it
happened both Hugh and Margot were near the window,
and threw themselves backwards. The professor, too,
saved himself by clutching at the sill of his window. The
entire balcony collapsed. It overturned, hung for a moment,
then fell with a rending of timbers. On examining
the debris Hugh found that the supports had been sawn
almost through, and that the cuts were quite fresh. Some
one had evidently done it during the night.</p>

<p>A week later when Hugh was returning home after midnight
a man rushed past him on the stairs. On the landing
beside his door a pungent smoke was coming from a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
sack of shavings. Beside it was a large can of petrol.
He beat out the fire. Had he arrived five minutes later the
place would have been in flames. After that he got some
ropes, so that in the case of future attempts to fire the
place, they might escape by the windows. He also bought
a Browning pistol.</p>

<p>That morning, as they entered the Casino, there was a
livid blaze of lightning, followed almost immediately by a
crash of thunder. Perhaps the professor was affected by
the storm, for his game was not so successful as usual; he
played seven <i>coups</i> before he struck a winning number.
Though his winnings were only thirty thousand francs, he
decided that he had had enough and rose from the table.
They heard the roar of the rain on the great dome above
them, and found on going to the entrance a most appalling
downpour. It was falling in crystal rods that beat the
oozing earth to bubbles. There was not a soul in sight.</p>

<p>“It’s useless trying to get a cab,” said Hugh. “Let
us go back to the atrium and wait till it clears up.”</p>

<p>They took a seat on one of the benches at the side of
the refreshment bar and waited for an hour without any
sign of the torrent abating. Every now and then Hugh
would go to the door and look out. The day had darkened
to a wan twilight in which the silver shafts of rain pearled
the pools and rivulets.</p>

<p>“One might as well stand under a shower-bath as go out
in that,” thought Hugh. “It would be the death of the
professor.” And again he sighed for a voiture.</p>

<p>As he looked out for the tenth time he saw Margot
making her way to the Casino through sheets of water.
She wore his Burberry and the rain ran off her in streams.
She was panting and pale with excitement.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>“Oh, I’m so glad I’ve found you. When the professor
came back alone, I was afraid something was wrong.”</p>

<p>“Professor come back alone! ... what do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Why, he’s there, in his room. When I heard him come
up the stairs and enter, I went to see if you were there, too.
As I knocked at the door, I heard him moving about inside.
I knocked again, but there was no answer. All
was quiet. What with the storm and everything else I
got nervous and excited. After knocking a couple of
times more I came here to find you.”</p>

<p>Hugh listened with growing amazement.</p>

<p>“Are you quite sure there’s some one in the professor’s
room?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes!”</p>

<p>Leading her into the atrium he pointed to the buffet.</p>

<p>“There’s the professor.”</p>

<p>“But the other ... the man in the house ...
now....”</p>

<p>“Stay with the professor. Don’t leave him. This looks
serious.”</p>

<p>Without waiting for the coat she held out to him, he
rushed into the rain and down the long steep hill, splashing
through water and mud. In a few minutes, drenched
and breathless, he reached the house. He mounted the
stairs softly, pistol in hand. Whoever had entered had
left the door on the latch. He burst into the room.</p>

<p>A man who had been bending over the steel safe rose
and swung around.</p>

<p>“Don’t shoot,” he said sharply. He stood there, erect,
composed, smiling.</p>

<p>“Krantz!”</p>

<p>“Precisely. What a pity you did not come ten minutes
later. Then I should have finished my investigations.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>“Your burglary, you mean. I’ve a good mind to call
the police.”</p>

<p>“My dear man, I <i>am</i> the police.”</p>

<p>“I am justified in shooting you.”</p>

<p>“If you did, you would surely regret it. Remember,
young man, you’re not in England, you’re not in France;
you’re in Monaco.”</p>

<p>“Does that justify <i>you</i>?”</p>

<p>“When the welfare of our beloved Principality is at
stake, I am justified in many things,—even in the examination
of private strong boxes.”</p>

<p>“Assassination too, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Oh no! I draw the line at that. In the Principality
we strongly disapprove of all violent measures.”</p>

<p>“What about the balcony, and the attempt to fire
the house?”</p>

<p>“I assure you, on my honour, I had nothing to do with
either. Of course, I am unable to answer for the zeal of
my subordinates. They are Monegasques and patriots.
You can understand their point of view. They believe
that one man’s life weighs as nothing against the welfare
of the community. They would willingly sacrifice their
lives for their country; but they prefer to sacrifice some
one else’s life. They are a crude and violent race. You
must excuse their ardour.”</p>

<p>“So you know nothing of those two attempts.”</p>

<p>“Officially, no. Of course, privately I have my ideas. I
did not go into the matter very closely. You see I have a
sense of delicacy, of tact. I am modern in my conceptions;
I deprecate the gentle art of assassination. But
again I repeat I am not responsible for the excessive zeal
of my subordinates. They are just grown up children,
many of them, passionate and impulsive. In the same way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
those whom I serve are not responsible for my acts,—this
investigation, for instance. In fact, I am sure they would
condemn it in the strongest of terms. Abuse of authority,
they would call it, and wax duly indignant. But please
put away that silly little pistol you are fingering so nervously.
It annoys me. I have no sense of the dramatic.”</p>

<p>Hugh lowered his hand and Krantz went on with his
urbane smile:</p>

<p>“You know I saved all your lives on one occasion. One
of my gentle patriots wanted to put a charge of dynamite
under your rooms and blow you to the stars. Fortunately
I found out in time, and prevented it. After all it would
have caused a great scandal. Violence and scandal we
do not like; we want everything to run smoothly in this
most favoured of spots. That’s what I’m here for,—to
see that things run smoothly. That is why a moment ago
you found me attempting the combination of that safe.
And now having failed in my mission, I presume you
will allow me to go.”</p>

<p>With that Krantz made a deep bow and passed from
the room. Hugh stared after his retreating back as he
leisurely descended the narrow stairway.</p>


<h4>3.</h4>

<p>Now that Hugh’s gambling fever had abated he found
himself looking at the players with apathy, even with disgust.
He was purged, not by loss, but by gain. The
thought of the fifty thousand francs he had wrested from
the bank was like honey to him. Never would he give
them a chance to win it back. The Casino itself had
also ceased to interest him. Incidents that had been at
first exciting, now appeared monotonous. The human<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
debris no longer fascinated him. The spectacle of the
squirming, scrabbling mob bored him. The systematizers
with their fatuous convictions aroused his contempt; the
besotted votaries of the game, his pity. More than all he
hated the careless rich who squandered in an idle hour
what would have kept many a widow from misery and
many an orphan from shame.</p>

<p>More than ever he thought of that little cottage at
Villefranche, between the silent mountains and the dreamy
sea; and of that Panhard he was going to buy at a bargain
price. He confided his discontent to the professor.</p>

<p>“I’m getting awfully fed up with Monte. We can’t go
on indefinitely. Isn’t it time that you speeded up the system
a little?”</p>

<p>“You are right,” sighed the professor, “but it fatigues
me so, and the atmosphere of the Rooms aggravates my
catarrh. Why will you not play? You are well instructed
now.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to. As I said before, I don’t hate the
Casino. While I wouldn’t move a finger to prevent their
ruin, I wouldn’t go out of my way to accomplish it. Then
again, if I played, I should want to play for myself, not
for society. To hell with society! It never did anything
for me. Up to now I’ve had to fight and struggle. It is
by sheer luck that I’ve got a little working capital and I
mean to make the most of it. I’m only a selfish practical
individual. I’ve no consuming wish to benefit mankind,
to do the ‘leave the world better than I found it,’ sort of
thing. If ever I have enough to keep me in modest comfort,
I’ll stop work and spend my time painting. No, I
fear I’m no philanthropist.... How much do you want
to win for your schemes before you proceed to give the
Casino the final knock out?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>“Fifty million.”</p>

<p>“And we have only ten. Heigh ho! I tell you I don’t
think I can stick it out.”</p>

<p>“I quite understand. Try to endure it two weeks more
and then we’ll see.”</p>

<p>Hugh continued to accompany the professor and to
watch him with monotonous certainty make his seventy
or eighty thousand francs a day. His association with
the old man had made him quite a celebrated character.
He shone with a reflected radiance, a moon to the old
man’s sun. He was supposed to be a partner, a sharer
in the colossal fortune, the professor’s heir and successor.</p>

<p>Many of the players were leaving Monte Carlo, for
the season was over. Mr. Tope had returned to his Kentish
cottage and his roses. The Calderbrooks, not being
able to afford the mountains, had convinced themselves
that Monte was even more charming in summer than in
winter. The father looked tired, but amiably acquiesced.</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Mrs. Calderbrook, “we don’t promise
to stay. If we have a bit of luck at the tables, we might
take a month or two at Chamounix.”</p>

<p>The tall Brazilian with the spade-shaped beard was still
a dominating figure in the Rooms. He wore great, horn-rimmed
spectacles of a yellowish colour and walked up
and down in an impeccable costume of white serge, his
hands behind his back, his carriage that of deliberate dignity.
He looked at the women harder than was necessary,
though he repulsed all their efforts to speak with him.
Once Hugh saw him turn to stare at the tall female in
grey. In spite of the growing heat she continued to wear
her veil and remained as mysterious as ever. She came
less frequently, but still seemed to have lots of money.</p>

<p>Of the old crowd there remained only MacTaggart and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
Mr. Gimp and they made their exit from the scene in a
very sensational manner.</p>


<h4>4.</h4>

<p>As MacTaggart had already paid him two thousand
francs, Hugh insisted on cancelling the debt between them.
MacTaggart was over eight thousand francs ahead, and
continued to play with hundred franc counters. Curiously
enough, his luck began to leave him as soon as he
gambled entirely for himself.</p>

<p>“It’s fair playin’ auld Harry wi’ ma nerves,” he said.
“The ither day I near fented at the table. After a’ they
years, I’m thinkin’, I’ll hea tae gie it up. Ma system’s
willin’ but the flesh is weak. I’m gettin’ that every time I
put a stake on the table ma hert dings like an alarm clock.
An’ ma temper. I don’t know whit I’m no’ capable o’
daein’ at times. It’s as if I had a kind o’ a brain-storm.
There’s whiles I’m fair feart for masel’. I often think
that if I wis once mair back in ma wee shop in Strathbungo,
I’d never want tae see a roulette wheel for the
rest o’ ma days.”</p>

<p>“What kind of a shop had you?”</p>

<p>“I’m a taxidermist, and though I say it masel’, there’s
no’ a better. It’s a nice quiet trade, soothin’ tae the
nerves. That’s whit’s the matter wi’ me, ma nerves.”</p>

<p>MacTaggart would probably have stayed until he had
lost all his gains, had not a kindly fate stepped in and
settled the matter for him.</p>

<p>He had been playing for three hours,—losing all the
time. His head ached, his nerves were raw, his temper
near to the breaking point. He wanted to smoke a cigarette
in the atrium, but had to leave some one to take
down his numbers. Beside him was a lady who was playing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
occasionally. She looked hot and very tired. MacTaggart
asked her if she would mind occupying his seat
for half an hour. She gladly consented, and he rose to
give her the place. At the same moment, a red, truculent-looking
Englishman on his other side, quickly put a
louis on the table in front of MacTaggart.</p>

<p>“I claim the place,” he said sharply.</p>

<p>MacTaggart turned and glared at him. “But I’m givin’
the place tae the leddy,” he said.</p>

<p>“The place is mine,” said the man. “You rose and I
put down my money. I appeal to the <i>Chef du Table</i>.”</p>

<p>The latter nodded. “By all the rules the place is
monsieur’s; monsieur has put down his money, marking
the place.”</p>

<p>MacTaggart was angry. He knew the croupiers did
not like him, that they always decided against him if possible.
He sat down again.</p>

<p>“All right,” he said, “in that case I’ll jist keep ma place.
I’ll sit here till Hell freezes over before ye get it.”</p>

<p>The face of the Englishman grew very red. His voice
rose nastily.</p>

<p>“But I insist on having the place. This man rose and
I put my money down. The place is clearly mine.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the <i>Chef du Table</i>, “it is evident that the
place is monsieur’s.”</p>

<p>“I’ll see ye dawmed firrst,” said MacTaggart, sitting
square. “There’s no force in Monte Carlo ’ill budge me
from this spot. Tak’ awaw yer dirrty money....”</p>

<p>He started to push away the man’s louis that lay in
front of him.</p>

<p>“Here, don’t touch my money. Don’t dare to touch
my money,” the Englishman exclaimed.</p>

<p>MacTaggart’s reply was to take the louis and flip it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
back at him. Every one was aghast. It was unheard of,
an outrage. One of the lymphatic lackeys recovered the
money and handed it to its owner, who was boiling over
with rage. There is no knowing how the row might have
ended had not a player opposite risen to catch a train,
and the <i>Chef</i>, with great presence of mind, promptly
claimed the place for the Englishman. The situation was
saved. <i>Tant Mieux.</i> That mad Ecossais looked quite
dangerous.</p>

<p>MacTaggart and the red-faced man sat opposite each
other, and muttered, growled, and glared. Then the second
incident occurred. Just as the ball was about to drop,
MacTaggart pushed a placque to the croupier.</p>

<p>“Passe, please.”</p>

<p>But the croupier did not hear him correctly and threw
it on pair, and at that moment the ball fell.</p>

<p>“<i>Vingt sept, passe impair et noir.</i>”</p>

<p>“But I telt ye tae pit it on passe,” said MacTaggart.</p>

<p>“No, monsieur said pair,” declared the croupier.</p>

<p>The <i>Chef</i> was appealed to. “Monsieur should have
seen that his money was rightly staked,” said the <i>Chef</i>
looking annoyed.</p>

<p>“Pay me,” cried MacTaggart, rising and clenching his
fist.</p>

<p>He was ignored and the ball started for the next spin.
Then MacTaggart did something unprecedented, something
outrageous. He took up one of the <i>rateaus</i> and
jammed it in the bowl of the wheel.</p>

<p>“By Goad,” said MacTaggart, “I’ll stop the bloody
game till ye pay me.”</p>

<p>At this moment the red-faced man came in to the discussion.
“I knew he was a crook,” he jeered. “Turn the
beggar out.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>MacTaggart stared at him. For a moment he could
not believe his ears, then a great glow came into his
eyes and he swung the <i>rateau</i> and brought it down on the
man’s head.</p>

<p>“Let me get at him,” he roared, “I’ll show him.”</p>

<p>The <i>Chef</i> laid a detaining hand on his shoulder, but
MacTaggart swung round and caught him on the chin.
The <i>Chef</i> went from his high chair like a ninepin. Shouting
something in Gaelic, MacTaggart sprang on the table.
Two croupiers tried to hold him back; but, using the
<i>rateau</i> like a claymore, he rapped each on the head and
with a leap was on the man with the red face.</p>

<p>“Turn me oot!” he shouted. “It wad tak a dizzen o’
the likes o’ you tae dae it.”</p>

<p>He had the big man down and was pounding him with
both fists, when four of the lethargic lackeys threw themselves
into the fray. MacTaggart saw red. He ran
amuck. Right and left he struck in Berserker rage. His
long arms were like flails before which men went down;
croupiers, attendants, inspectors, all staggered back beneath
his blows. A superintendent who ran up to see what
was wrong, received a punch that landed him on his back.
As MacTaggart burst through the doorway into the “Hall
of Gloom,” the director of the games rushed up.</p>

<p>“Look out,” said the big Scotchman, “or as sure as my
name’s Galloway MacTaggart I’ll fell ye tae the floor.”</p>

<p>The director did not look out and was duly downed.
Then a group of lackeys, by a concerted rush, succeeded
in mastering him. They knocked him down and hung onto
his heaving arms and legs. They lifted him to carry him
to the door. The MacTaggart was conquered.</p>

<p>But was he? No, not yet. From the other end of the
“Hall of Light” a shrill yell suddenly split the air. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
was something between the execration of a college football
coach, and the war whoop of a red Indian. A little white-haired
gentleman was covering the intervening space in
great leaps and bounds. He roared and whirled his arms,
his eyes aflame, his very hair bristling with fury. It was
Mr. Gimp.</p>

<p>The attendants released MacTaggart, and turned to
face this new foe. The fight began all over again.</p>

<p>It was Homeric, for Mr. Gimp had once been a bantam
champion of the ring. There were bloody noses and
broken teeth; there were curses and cries of pain; there
were black eyes and bruised ribs before the indomitable
two, overwhelmed by numbers, were carried to the door.
The fray had lasted a quarter of an hour.</p>

<p>“Weel,” said MacTaggart that night as they sat in
Quinto’s, “I’m thinkin’, Gimpy, auld man, we’ve lost oor
tickets. We’ll no’ daur show oor faces in that place ony
mair.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Mr. Gimp, “the spell’s broken at last. I’m a
free man. To-morrow I’m off to the land where the handshake’s
warmer.”</p>

<p>“An’ me fur Strathbungo. Eh, man, they got us oot,
but it took a score o’ them tae dae it. An’ by Goad! we
laft oor mark on every mither’s son.”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER THREE<br />


TEMPTATION</h3>
</div>

<h4>1.</h4>

<p class="drop-cap">HUGH continued to be haunted by thoughts of
Mrs. Belmire. At times he felt he would throw
up everything to follow her; at others he consigned
her to the devil. He had resolved to let her make
the first advance and carefully avoided meeting her.</p>

<p>One day on returning home, Margot handed him an
envelope bearing the initials M. B. He was not altogether
pleased and put it in his pocket until he should be alone.
He tore it open later and read:</p>

<p>“<i>How could I be so horrid to you the last time we met?
Can you forgive me enough to meet me this evening at
Ciro’s at ten o’clock? It will probably be adieu. I am
leaving for Vichy on Friday.</i>”</p>

<p>The humility of the note touched him. She had put
herself in the wrong. Nothing like a show of indifference
with women, he thought. His vanity was flattered. A
sentiment of generosity akin to tenderness glowed in him.
Quite eagerly he awaited the evening.</p>

<p>She arrived a little late, wearing a very exquisite evening
gown. She rightly believed that her shoulders and
arms added to her charm. She took his hand in a firm,
good-fellow grip. As she sat down he was conscious of
the perfume she affected. She seemed to him to be stunning,
the real thing, a <i>femme de luxe</i>.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>Her manner was subdued to the point of mournfulness.
It was one of her favourite moods and was in harmony
with the melancholy of the restaurant. The orchestra
played dispiritedly. Two teams of professional dancers
shimmied in a forlorn fashion. Even the waiters looked
listless.</p>

<p>“This place will be closing soon,” she sighed. “Monte
is dying. All the right sort have gone already. I feel
almost like a derelict. I’m bored to the verge of tears.
For God’s sake do something to console me. Buy me a
bottle of Cliquot.”</p>

<p>When the waiter brought it in its silver bucket of ice,
the bottle looked very comforting. As they sipped, she
grew more cheerful.</p>

<p>“Thank goodness I’m going. I say, why don’t you
come, too? Do the giddy round,—Paris for the Grand
Prix, Deauville, Biarritz,—one meets the same crowd at
all these places, the world that lives to enjoy itself. Let’s
enjoy ourselves.”</p>

<p>“I don’t belong to that world. I’m a quiet chap. I
want a quiet life.”</p>

<p>“And I—I want a gay one. But I’m lonely. God! at
times I’m so lonely, I could shoot myself or get drunk.
I say, let’s get drunk to-night.”</p>

<p>“You’re joking.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose I am. But that’s just how I feel. I
don’t know why. Perhaps its because I won’t see you
again. Oh, I say,—be a priceless darling. Do come.”</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders. He felt her power, the
melting appeal of her eyes, the caress of her hand. Passion
was invading him. He wanted to seize her, crush her,
hurt her. “Why not,” he thought, “a month of that gay
life! It would cost a good deal, but perhaps it would be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
worth it. A delirious month....” Then he heard himself
saying:</p>

<p>“No, it’s no use. I can’t go.”</p>

<p>She stamped her foot pettishly. The spell was broken.
After a little she resumed:</p>

<p>“Well, if you won’t come with me, you won’t refuse to
help me. I’m in debt all round. I owe quite a lot of
money to the pension, too. I don’t know how much. I
have no head for figures. I’m like a child in financial
matters. I say, dear boy, you’ll lend me a bit, won’t you?
I’ve counted on you, you know.”</p>

<p>He winced. His lips tightened.</p>

<p>“How much?”</p>

<p>“Oh, a little bunch of <i>milles</i>. Ten or twenty will do.
What does it matter to you? You’re rich. You’re
making millions. You’re not stingy, are you?”</p>

<p>He felt the time had come for an explanation. “Look
here,” he said, “you’re all wrong. You assumed from
the start I was a somebody and had something. I’m
really a nobody and I have nothing. You might even call
me an adventurer. I came here broken in health and practically
penniless. Now I am strong and fit again. And
I have some money, fifty thousand francs, which I managed
to wrench from the Casino. That’s all I’ve got, I
swear it. I’m not mean, but I’ve known bitter poverty
and don’t want to know it again.”</p>

<p>She was looking at him in sheer amazement. He warmed
to his subject, and spoke with a gusto that was almost
malicious.</p>

<p>“That money means life to me. It means a home, a
chance to make a living by healthy, agreeable work. I’m
going to buy a car. Next year if you’re here and you
see me standing in line waiting for a job, you can hire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
me. Now you know me. That’s the sort I am, a penniless
adventurer. I should have told you before, but I enjoyed
being with you so much that I postponed the confession.
Well, that’s over any way. And now what are you going
to do?”</p>

<p>For a full minute she was speechless. Then she said
breathlessly:</p>

<p>“But you are making millions, you and that old man.
Every one knows it. You are partners....”</p>

<p>“No, not partners. I never touch a <i>sou</i> of what he
makes.”</p>

<p>“But ... he’s like a father to you. He’ll give you
anything you want. A million if you ask. I am sure.”</p>

<p>“I don’t intend to ask.”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand,” said Mrs. Belmire.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t think you do; I don’t think you can. I’m
sorry, but.... Hullo! there’s that fellow Vulning. By
Jove! he’s coming in here. Drunk as a tinker, too, I’ll
swear.”</p>

<p>She shrugged her beautiful shoulders. She sat silent,
her chin propped on her hands, staring into vacancy with
stormy, scornful eyes. Yes, she was lovely. Now that
he had told her everything he was half sorry. She was
lost to him. She would turn on him presently, and call
him a most unmerciful bounder. Well, he deserved it. He
waited. He felt sorry for her, she seemed so bowled over.
Then suddenly she turned to him, fixing him with an intense
gaze.</p>

<p>“I counted on you. Oh, how I counted on you!”</p>

<p>Tears and reproach were in her voice. At that moment
he almost yielded, almost promised her the money.
Even as he hesitated, his attention was attracted by Paul
Vulning.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>Vulning was standing at the bar. He was dressed in a
golfing suit and looked as if he had been on a long debauch.
His face was puffy and muddily red, his cheeks
and chin bristly; his eyes fishy when they were not wild.
He stared round the room, and recognized Mrs. Belmire,
but he did not notice Hugh.</p>

<p>“Hullo! Marion,” he cried. “Come on, old girl, and
have a Scotch.”</p>

<p>She did not pay any attention, but continued to brood,
her chin in her cupped hands. He shouted once more.</p>

<p>“Here, don’t be haughty. You weren’t always too
proud to drink at a bar. Well, I’ll come over and join
you.”</p>

<p>Carrying his glass unsteadily, he made his way towards
them.</p>

<p>“Brute!” said Hugh.</p>

<p>“Don’t take any notice of him,” said Mrs. Belmire contemptuously.
“He’s always beastly when he’s in that
state.”</p>

<p>Vulning halted.</p>

<p>“Excuse me. Didn’t notice you had a fellow. Never
mind. We’re all pals here, ain’t we?”</p>

<p>He sat down unsteadily. “All pals.... <i>Damn you!</i>”</p>

<p>He had suddenly recognized Hugh, and he bent forward
with a snarl like that of an angry dog.</p>

<p>“You bloody whipper-snapper.... Bah!”</p>

<p>Hugh restrained himself with difficulty, and sat tense.
The frown on Mrs. Belmire’s face deepened. Vulning’s
snarl gradually relaxed to a sneer. He meant mischief.</p>

<p>“You’re looking rippin’ to-night, Marion. ’Pon my
soul I never saw you looking so stunning.”</p>

<p>He put out a rather dirty hand and patted her white
shoulder. She drew back.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>“Don’t touch me, you beast!”</p>

<p>Hugh broke in tempestuously. “Don’t do that again,
you dog, or I’ll knock you down.”</p>

<p>Vulning gave a sneering laugh, then suddenly grew
fierce.</p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t I do it if I choose? What’s it got to
do with you, you young whelp? What can you do?”</p>

<p>“I can make you respect a lady in my presence.”</p>

<p>“Respect! Lady!” Vulning burst into a roar of
laughter. “That a lady! <i>That!</i> Why, man, she’s been
my mistress. She’s been the mistress of a dozen men I
know. She’s anybody’s woman. Respect! Her! Oh
you young fool! You poor flat.... <i>Ach!</i>”</p>

<p>He choked. Hugh had clutched him by the collar and
was shaking him savagely. Vulning struck out wildly, but
Hugh hurled him to the floor and stood over him.</p>

<p>“Come on,” said Mrs. Belmire wearily, “I’m going.”</p>

<p>She went to the door alone, pulling her cloak over her
dazzling shoulders. Hugh hesitated, then followed her.</p>

<p>“I’d better see you home,” he said.</p>

<p>“Home!” she laughed bitterly. “I had a home once. I
don’t suppose I’ll ever have another.”</p>

<p>“Was it true? What he said?”</p>

<p>Her voice was hard, scornful. “Yes, all true. What
would you? I must live. I was brought up to do nothing.
My husband died leaving me only his debts. Try to
understand! Put yourself in my place. Men are brutes.
A woman must prey or be preyed on. You are the first
decent, clean man I’ve met since ... oh, ever so long.
And you’ve never suspected?...”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t think <i>that</i> of you. I suppose it was because
I didn’t want to think it. I thought you were foolish,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
worldly, of limited means but straight, quite straight.
I swear I did.”</p>

<p>“And now that you know you will never see me again?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I must think it out. We have both been
deceived in the other.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we must both think it out. Here’s the pension.
Good-night.”</p>

<p>“Good-night.”</p>


<h4>2.</h4>

<p>Two days later Hugh persuaded the professor to play
more rapidly, with the result that in less than two hours
the old man had won nearly two hundred thousand francs.
The effort exhausted him and he retired to his bed for
the day. He intended to repeat the performance the next
morning.</p>

<p>When Hugh returned, he found Margot laying the table
for lunch. He noticed that her hands trembled. Though
quiet and reserved as always, she had a strange sullen set
to her mouth and a resentful look in her eyes. Presently
she said:</p>

<p>“A lady came to see you this morning.”</p>

<p>“A lady! Here! Who was it?”</p>

<p>“A haughty English lady,—with dyed hair.”</p>

<p>With some annoyance Hugh applied this description to
Mrs. Belmire.</p>

<p>“What did she say?”</p>

<p>“I did not let her in. She took me for the domestic. I
was scrubbing the kitchen and not very tidy. I said you
were out and I had not the faintest idea when you would
be in.”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“She then said: ‘Tell him I will dine at the Carlton to-night<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
at eight, and expect him to have dinner with me.’
I bobbed my head and answered, ‘Yes, ma’am.’ Then she
said, ‘Do you think you can give that message correctly,
my girl?’ I answered again, ‘Yes, ma’am. I think my
intelligence will be equal to the strain you are putting
on it.’ She then offered me a franc but I refused it.”</p>

<p>“Damn it! I’m sorry she came.... I mean I’m sorry
you were put in such a position.”</p>

<p>“I think I’d better go away. Is that the lady you go
about with so much?”</p>

<p>“How do you know I go about with her?”</p>

<p>“I’ve seen you; lots of times. She’s a bad woman, I
tell you. I know all about her. She’s ruined lots of men.
She’ll ruin you, too.”</p>

<p>The girl seemed to be trembling with suppressed rage.
Hugh became angry.</p>

<p>“I’m quite capable of taking care of myself,” he said
coldly.</p>

<p>“Are you going to see her to-night?”</p>

<p>“I don’t see what that’s got to do with you.”</p>

<p>“Because if you do, I won’t stay here. I’ll leave to-night.
I swear I will.”</p>

<p>“You seem determined to create an atmosphere of unpleasantness.
I don’t like it. I’ll go and get lunch elsewhere.”</p>

<p>He ate at the Bristol. Later, he took a walk, went for
a swim, had tea at Scapini’s, and strolled about the
“Cheese.” He could not get the thought of Margot out of
his head. What had got into her? It was none of her
business whom he went with. He would not let any one exercise
a control over his actions. As for her going away,
it was an empty threat. She had said the same thing
before. What did Mrs. Belmire want with him? It would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
be safer, perhaps, not to see her again. It was playing
with fire....</p>

<p>At seven o’clock, nevertheless, he went home and
changed into his evening clothes. As he was going out
Margot stood by the door.</p>

<p>“You’re going, then?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said curtly.</p>

<p>“Very well, then, I warn you; you won’t find me here
when you come back.”</p>

<p>“Do as you please. You are entirely mistress of your
own actions.”</p>

<p>He passed her, slamming the door.</p>


<h4>3.</h4>

<p>He found Mrs. Belmire waiting for him. She had reserved
a table in one of the alcoves and looked very bewitching.</p>

<p>“This is my farewell supper. I had intended to invite
some other men; then I thought it would be nicer,
just we two.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Belmire’s invitations to supper always included the
privilege of paying for it. She seemed to have made up
her mind to be the most charming of hostesses. She ordered
an exquisite brand of champagne and kept Hugh’s
glass filled. She talked vivaciously, with long deep looks
into his eyes, and little caressing touches of her hands.
She nestled close to him, so close that it was disconcerting
to look down on the delicious curves of dazzling flesh,
emerging in such radiant and insolent beauty from a
gown that sheathed her to the bust in front, and was cut
to the waist behind.</p>

<p>It was a gala night. There was a gay crowd of dancers;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
brilliant Chinese lanterns were strung closely overhead,
and the walls and columns were covered with fanciful
decorations of coloured crêpe paper.</p>

<p>“Don’t you love it all?” she sighed. “Light, love,
laughter,—what a part they play in life.”</p>

<p>He was inclined to agree with her. The triumphant
wine was singing through his veins; the mad music was
goading him to a frenzy of happiness; the dazzling shoulders
and gleaming arms of Mrs. Belmire were pagan in
their beauty. The whole combination, wine, woman, song,
was for him. Every fibre of his will was weakening in this
atmosphere of sheer delight.</p>

<p>“She’s got me going,” he almost groaned. When she
turned away her head he emptied his champagne on the
floor.</p>

<p>Seeing his glass empty she plied him with another.
“You don’t drink anything,” she said. “Come, it’s a poor
heart that never rejoices. Let’s abandon ourselves. It’s
so jolly nice to be together like this. I wish it could last
forever.”</p>

<p>The champagne was taking possession of his sense. He
saw her through a roseate mist, a wholly voluptuous, desireful
creature. He had drunk nearly two-thirds of the
wine; more would be fatal. To avoid real intoxication, he
stimulated a slight false one.</p>

<p>“No more of the damned stuff,” he said roughly. “My
head’s all buzzing with it. It’s poison. The tears of
widows and orphans, the widows and orphans the old professor’s
working for....”</p>

<p>She leaned forward eagerly. “I heard you made quite
a lot to-day.”</p>

<p>“He made nearly quarter of a million ... for his
widows and orphans.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>“Why for them? Why not for you, for us?”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t you like to be rich? Wouldn’t you like to
have a life like this always,—flowers, music, good wine,
delicate food, a life of luxury?”</p>

<p>“No, I wouldn’t. I want quiet and simplicity. I don’t
want to be rich.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you make me lose patience. You say you would
like to be a painter. Well, why not study,—Paris, Rome
and so on?”</p>

<p>“That takes money. I haven’t got it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you have. All you want. Millions!”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you later. Have some more wine.”</p>

<p>“No, no. I’ve had enough. You want to make me
drunk. Come on, let’s leave this cursed <i>bordel</i>. My head’s
splitting. I want fresh air.”</p>

<p>“Poor boy! You want to lie down a bit. I say, come
and stretch, <i>chez moi</i>. You can smoke a cigarette and
have a snooze if you like. It’s quiet there.”</p>

<p>He would have broken away, but she held his arm and
called a <i>voiture</i>. It was exactly ten o’clock when they left
the restaurant and descended to the Pension Pizzicato.
Once in the open air the fumes of the wine affected him
with sudden drowsiness.</p>

<p>“Look here,” he said, “I do believe I’m a bit squiffy.
Perhaps I’d better lie down on your sofa for half an
hour.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good boy. Come on.”</p>

<p>He remembered descending unsteadily from the <i>voiture</i>
and stumbling up to her room. They met no one on the
way. He threw himself on her divan and closed his eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span></p>


<h4>4.</h4>

<p>When he opened them again she was bending over him.
She wore a lilac peignoir that clothed her loosely. As
he looked at her, surprised, she said:</p>

<p>“My dear boy, how’s your poor head? You know
you’ve slept nearly two hours. And look who’s here,—Mr.
Fetterstein. He came just a few minutes after we
did. We’ve been chatting.”</p>

<p>Fetterstein was comfortably seated, smoking a huge
cigar, and drinking a whiskey and soda. He grunted
amiably to Hugh.</p>

<p>“Yey, boy! Some snorer too, hey, Mrs. B.? Well,
feelin’ better?”</p>

<p>“Yes, thanks. I’m all right now.”</p>

<p>“Have a cigar?”</p>

<p>“No, thanks.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you’ll excuse me I’ll hit the hay. I’m not the
night-hawk I used to be. Gettin’ old, hey! I’ll leave the
rounder game to you young bloods. Good-night, young
chap.”</p>

<p>When he had gone Mrs. Belmire came impulsively to
Hugh and knelt by the side of his chair.</p>

<p>“My poor darling! Are you really feeling better? We
talked low so as not to disturb you. Old Fetterstein’s
not a bad sort. You mustn’t mind him. You know he
wants me to go to Vichy with him. He will pay all my
debts.”</p>

<p>“Are you going?”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to. I want to go with you. Let’s go to
Venice. It’s a dream.”</p>

<p>He looked at her in a dazed way. She put her arms
around his neck.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>“Oh, come. You’re the only man I love in all the world.
In a few more years I will be <i>passée</i>; but now I am at my
very best. Look at me. Don’t I please you? Take me.
I’ll be everything to you as long as you like. When you
tire of me, I’ll go. I’ll be yours, all yours. I’m not fickle.
I’ll love you, you alone. You won’t regret it. We’ll live
in places that glitter and glow; we will drink to the full
the wine of life. Oh, take me, take me....”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand. How can I do these things? I’m
not a man of wealth....”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, you are, if you like. There’s the old professor.
You know how to play as he does. You can get
hold of his books, copy his figures. We’ll go to San
Sebastien, Buenos Ayres, everywhere roulette is allowed.
Play, play for yourself. Become rich. Life without
money is hell. Come! you’ll do it. Won’t you, won’t
you....”</p>

<p>She clung to him. He looked at her with something
like horror.</p>

<p>“You want me to <i>steal</i> the professor’s system?”</p>

<p>“Yes, if you want to put it that way. Why not? He’s
old, half mad. Charity begins at home. Why not?”</p>

<p>“Never!”</p>

<p>“You will ... you will....”</p>

<p>She seemed to be holding him with all the strength of her
body; she kissed him like a mad thing. He could feel her
hot panting breath on his face, see her eyes burn into his.</p>

<p>“No, a thousand times no!”</p>

<p>She was like a splendid animal mad with passion. He
rose and wrenching her arms apart, backed away from
her, a look of repulsion in his eyes. She saw it and knew
she was defeated.</p>

<p>She crouched by the empty chair, her head dropping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
on her outstretched arms. She seemed to be sobbing.</p>

<p>He paused by the door. Something forlorn in her
attitude touched him.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” he said. “If I were mad for love of you,
I would do anything you asked me, but ... I’m not.
I can’t go with you because I don’t care for you in that
way. I realize it now. Perhaps I should have known it
sooner. Please forgive me.”</p>

<p>She rose and faced him.</p>

<p>“Forgive you.... You poor fool! Did you think I
meant it? Why, I was only acting. Did you think I
cared for you? It’s only money I care for, money, money.
I offered myself to you and you refused me. You are the
only man who ever did that. It’s that that hurts. You’ve
wounded me in a way time will never heal. I hate you,
hate you! Oh, I could kill you. Go!...”</p>

<p>She pointed to the door, then turning, once again dropped
beside the chair. She was really crying now, shaken
with great rending sobs.</p>

<p>He left her. As he passed in front of the dark Casino,
the pinkish face of the clock showed it to be one in the
morning. All the way downhill to the Condamine he did
not meet a soul. There was no moon; and the quietness
was almost eerie.</p>

<p>The passage leading to the house was as dark as a
tunnel of anthracite. He plunged into its blackness, then
stopped short. A man was blocking his way. Instinctively
his hand went to his hip pocket for his automatic.
Assassins....</p>

<p>Then a second man, darting from behind, gripped his
arms. He struggled madly; but the first man, closing in,
struck at him with something hard, and he remembered
no more.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER FOUR<br />


ARREST</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“WHERE am I?”</p>

<p>About him were bare, white-washed walls;
the light came by grudgingly through a
small barred window that gave on rock and shrub. He
struggled to a sitting position on the pallet bed on which
he lay. The place reeled round and round. He groaned,
and put his hand to his head. It was bandaged. It ached
atrociously. What had happened? He tried to think,
but thinking was painful. Memory returned in gleams and
dashes. Bit by bit the evening before came back to him.
But how to account for his present position? He gave
up the effort and lay down again.</p>

<p>A man entered, a rather grim, brown man in a kind of
uniform.</p>

<p>“Monsieur has awakened?”</p>

<p>“Yes, what place is this?”</p>

<p>“It is the detention room of the Monaco Police Station.”</p>

<p>“But why am I here?”</p>

<p>“Monsieur was arrested only this morning.”</p>

<p>“Arrested! Good Heavens! Why?”</p>

<p>“Ah! that is not for me to say. Monsieur will be
brought before the examining magistrate in an hour.
Will monsieur take <i>petit déjeuner</i>?”</p>

<p>“Bring me some strong coffee. It may buck me up.”</p>

<p>The coffee cleared his head wonderfully and helped him
to realize his position. He had been arrested last night<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
by those two men in the dark entry. They certainly had
used him roughly enough. He would make a deuce of a
row about that. The whole thing was outrageous, an
error or else a dastardly plot. Then he became uneasy.
Anything might happen here. He was at the mercy of
the powers that be. They might throw him into one of
the dungeons of the Castle. Sinister forebodings invaded
him.</p>

<p>Presently two policemen came for him, and he walked
between them to a large room where three men were sitting
at a curving desk. Their backs were to a double
window but he was placed in the glare of the strong light.</p>

<p>The three men were dusky Monegascans. They wore
black frock coats and black bow ties. The centre one was
severe and stout, the one on the right severe and thin, the
third was young, intelligent and amiable looking. It
was evident they were important personages in the judiciary
system of the Principality, probably the examining
magistrate, the state attorney and the chief of police.
The stout one addressed him curtly.</p>

<p>“Your name is Hugh Kildair?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“You inhabit a room on the third floor of the Villa
Lorenza?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>The magistrate consulted his notes. There was a
silence. Hugh saw six piercing eyes fixed on his face.</p>

<p>“Can you account for your movements from ten o’clock
until midnight yesterday evening?”</p>

<p>Hugh reflected that his movements during that time
consisted of somewhat stertorous respirations on the sofa
of Mrs. Belmire’s sitting room, and hesitated. But after
all, he thought, he had no need to be reticent as far as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
Mrs. Belmire was concerned. He resented those damned
descendants of Saracen pirates, though. What had they
against him?</p>

<p>“I don’t understand,” he protested. “What have I
been arrested for? It’s an outrage. I’ll appeal to the
British consul.”</p>

<p>The youngest of the men interposed smoothly. “You
do not seem to realize the seriousness of your position,
monsieur. You will do well to answer the question.”</p>

<p>Hugh was impressed.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, “I was with a lady, if you wish to
know.”</p>

<p>“Kindly give us her name.”</p>

<p>“A Mrs. Belmire, an English lady.”</p>

<p>The three exchanged glances. The thin one shrugged
his shoulders. The pleasant one smiled meaningly.</p>

<p>“She is known to us,” said the fat one. “Will you be so
good as to tell us where and how you passed the entire
evening.”</p>

<p>Hugh repressed his growing indignation. He answered
sullenly enough:</p>

<p>“I met her at eight at the Carlton. We had dinner. At
ten we took a <i>voiture</i> and went to her hotel. There I fell
asleep on her sofa and awoke about twelve. I remained
till nearly one, when I left for my room. In the dark
entry of the house where I live, my way was barred by a
man.... But then you know more than I do about
what happened from then on.”</p>

<p>“Why did you attempt to draw your pistol?”</p>

<p>“I was nervous. In the past few weeks there have been
attempts to injure me.”</p>

<p>The pleasant looking man nodded confirmation to this.
The thin man then said:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>“We had better get hold of the English lady at once.
She is not the most desirable of witnesses, but ... if
what monsieur says is supported, he has an undeniable
alibi and we can release him.”</p>

<p>“Release me! Of course, you will. What have I done,
tell me. What am I charged with?”</p>

<p>“There is no charge yet. You are arrested on suspicion
only.”</p>

<p>“Of what?”</p>

<p>The three looked at each other. Then the fat one bent
forward dramatically.</p>

<p>“Of murder.”</p>

<p>“Good God! Whose murder?”</p>

<p>The lean one fixed his piercing eyes on Hugh’s face.</p>

<p>“<i>Professor Durand was murdered in his room last night,
between ten and twelve.</i>”</p>

<p>All three watched him closely. He was dazed by the
shock. He stared at them blankly.</p>

<p>“Horrible!” he murmured. “The poor old man ...
murdered!...”</p>

<p>“Yes, stabbed to the heart.”</p>

<p>“But who did it? Why have you arrested me?”</p>

<p>“Because the concierge says he saw you go up to the
old man’s room a little after ten, and leave a little after
eleven.”</p>

<p>“Me!”</p>

<p>“Yes. If you can prove that you were elsewhere, then
the man must have been mistaken. We’ll see the English
lady at once.”</p>

<p>But alas! a telephone call to the Pension Pizzicato informed
them that Mrs. Belmire had left early that morning
with Mr. Fetterstein in a high powered car. Destination
unknown.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>“Hum!” said the magistrate, “that makes it bad for
you. We are willing to release you if you can prove an
incontestable alibi. We don’t want any trouble here. But
if you cannot we must hand you over to the French authorities.”</p>

<p>“Hold on,” said Hugh. “Fetterstein was there too, in
the room.”</p>

<p>“You mean Monsieur Fetterstein, the multi-millionaire
American?”</p>

<p>“Yes, the same.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” All three looked impressed.</p>

<p>“If only Monsieur Fetterstein would testify in your
favour that would end the matter as far as you are concerned.
He is well known to us and much esteemed.”</p>

<p>“But can’t you find him?”</p>

<p>“That might be hard. There is all France to search.
Cannot your friends here hire a lawyer, get some one to
help you,—a detective?...”</p>

<p>Hugh considered. “Perhaps Monsieur Krantz would
help me.”</p>

<p>They looked surprised; Hugh went on:</p>

<p>“Will you let him know the position I’m in? If any one
can find them he can.”</p>

<p>The chief of police nodded. “He’s already interested
in the case.”</p>

<p>The magistrate talked with the others in the Monegascan
dialect. Finally he said:</p>

<p>“We will see what we can do. In the meantime you
must remain here. We will investigate the affair thoroughly.
If you are innocent you need have no fear of the
result. That is all I can say for the present.”</p>

<p>Hugh was conducted back to his cell, and left to his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
own reflections. He sat for a long time in a state verging
on stupor. The professor murdered,—that was the
thought that drove all others from his head, made him
forget even his own plight. The professor murdered!
But by whom? There were those who had reason enough
to want the old man out of the way; there were those who
would rejoice at his death. But assassination! No, they
would surely draw the line at that. Krantz had a drastic
way of dealing with criminals, but he would never stain
his hands with the blood of honest men. Still, he had admitted
he could not always keep his subordinates in check.</p>

<p>If, then, it had not been the act of an irresponsible tool
of Krantz, who else had an interest in disposing of the
professor? As he lay through the long day he pondered
on this. How slowly the time passed! He thought sadly
that all his friends had gone. MacTaggart, Gimp, Tope,
he was sure they would have hurried to his aid. Margot,
too! Why had she not come? She must know by now
where he was. A strange longing to see her came over
him. It would be more comforting to see her than any
one else.</p>

<p>In the evening to his surprise Krantz arrived. The
detective entered with a smile of cheerful mockery that
was rather irritating to a man in Hugh’s position.</p>

<p>“Hullo,” he said, laughing as if it was quite funny,
“you’ve got yourself into a nice mess.”</p>

<p>“Have I?”</p>

<p>“Looks like it, doesn’t it? Here’s your concierge swearing
you were in the old man’s room at the time the murder
was committed. You say that you were elsewhere,
but you cannot produce your witnesses. You name two
people who have left the country, gone goodness knows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
where. Doesn’t it strike you that if they should not
come back to testify for you, you will be in a devilish
awkward box?”</p>

<p>“Look here, Krantz, you know I didn’t do it.”</p>

<p>“Of course, I know it,” said Krantz smilingly.</p>

<p>“And you know who did do it.”</p>

<p>The face of Krantz grew very grave. “Hum! I’m not
so sure of that.”</p>

<p>“But what was the motive?”</p>

<p>“Robbery, of course. Didn’t they tell you that the
safe was opened, all the papers taken? He had better
luck than I, whoever he was.”</p>

<p>“And the system?”</p>

<p>“Stolen. That’s unfortunate. I wish I knew who he
was.”</p>

<p>“Whoever has it can’t use it,” said Hugh. “It’s in
cypher, and there’s only one man who can decipher it.”</p>

<p>“Who’s that?”</p>

<p>“Me.”</p>

<p>“That’s interesting. Humph! I’ll remember that.”</p>

<p>Krantz thoughtfully tapped the floor with his cane for
a full minute. Then he rose.</p>

<p>“I’m going to help you if I can. I’ll try to find your
two witnesses so that you can establish your alibi. But if
I get you clear, and should ever want your aid (in an honourable
way, of course) you’ll help me?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“All right. Don’t worry. Good-night.”</p>

<p>The visit of Krantz cheered Hugh and he was able to
get some sleep. But the next two days crawled past
miserably. Except for the warders with his food no
one came near him; again his fears took shape. What if
Mrs. Belmire and Fetterstein could not be found! Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
Belmire probably hated him and might be glad to revenge
herself on him by keeping out of the way. But no, he
thought, she was too good a sport for that. There was
Fetterstein, too. Everything must come right. The time
seemed so long.</p>

<p>On the fourth day he was again ushered into the bureau.
The stout magistrate was at his desk and beside him sat
the chief of police. He smiled benignly at Hugh.</p>

<p>“Everything has been explained,” he said, “as far as
you are concerned. You are released. You need have no
further fear. We regret exceedingly we have been obliged
to put you to the inconvenience.”</p>

<p>He bowed with a gesture of dismissal, and Hugh lost
no time in leaving the room. As he emerged from the
police station a voice hailed him:</p>

<p>“Hullo there! Sorry we didn’t know you were in such
a hell of a fix or we’d have got here sooner. They connected
with us at Marseilles and we came right on in the
car. We’ve just been and interviewed the old guy. You
bet we soon straightened things out. By the way, allow
me to present you to Mrs. Fetterstein.”</p>

<p>Hugh stared. Fetterstein with a hearty laugh was indicating
a lady who was arranging her motoring veil. It
was Mrs. Belmire. She looked radiant.</p>

<p>“Yes, we were married in Marseilles yesterday. Oh, I’m
so happy! He’s really such a nice old thing. You’ve no
idea. We’re going to Italy for our honeymoon. So sorry
we didn’t know you were in trouble, or we’d have simply
flown to the rescue. He’s made an affidavit, or something
of the kind. Well, all’s well that ends well. Now we must
be getting on. Come, you precious old dear. Good-bye,
Mr. Kildair. Hope we’ll all meet again.”</p>

<p>Hugh had no time for congratulations. They sprang<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
into a great cheese-coloured car, and were gone, leaving
him in a state of utter bewilderment.</p>

<p>He made his way slowly back to the house he called
home. Forebodings assailed him. The concierge had
gone, no doubt dreading awkward explanations. Looking
up Hugh saw that the windows of the professor’s room
were shuttered. So also were his own. To find his room
so dark, so silent, struck a chill to his heart!</p>

<p>“Margot! Margot!”</p>

<p>No reply. He pulled aside the grey curtain. Her bed
had not been slept in. He searched everywhere for a
note from her. Nothing! Had she carried out her
threat? Had she left him as she had said she would?</p>

<p>He went slowly down stairs and asked the tenant of
the room below for news. The woman shook her head.</p>

<p>“The <i>petite blonde</i>? No, I know nothing of her. She
disappeared the night of the crime.”</p>

TRAPPED</h3>
</div>

<h4>1.</h4>

<p class="drop-cap">THE next three days were more miserable to Hugh
than those he had spent in prison. He missed
Margot keenly. He had become so used to her;
she had waited on him so devotedly; had made herself so
essential to him in a hundred little ways. Her sudden
desertion of him when he most needed her filled him with
dismay.</p>

<p>He felt injured, too. He had done a good deal for her.
He had always been a perfect brother, respectful and
courteous. If she had been a real sister, he could not
have thought more of her. If he could get her back he
would be even more considerate. He would take her to
the cinema, to tea sometimes, even for a drive occasionally.
The trouble was, if he went about with her, people would
jump at wrong conclusions. Well, in future, let ’em jump.
He would buy that cottage and she should keep house for
him. He wondered if it would be possible to legally adopt
her as a sister. Then she could live with him until she
found the man she wanted to marry. Why not?</p>

<p>Where was she? In Paris, no doubt; taking up the
weary struggle once more. She would surely write soon,
then he would go and fetch her. Why had she left most
of her clothes, he wondered? All the things he had bought
her? Perhaps she did not want to take them. The sight
of her abandoned garments made him lonelier than ever.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>She must have left just before the crime. If she had
been there, it might not have happened, she always kept
such a watchful eye on the old man’s door. How shocked
she would be. She had been so fond of the professor, fussing
over him, doing things for him. Poor man! So that
was the end of all his grandiose schemes. And the system
was useless, for only he, Hugh, had the key. Well, he was
glad it had been stolen. He had always hated it. There
had been something so uncanny about it. Although it was
always successful, it seemed to bring misfortune on all connected
with it.</p>

<p>He felt the shadow of the tragedy penetrating even to
his room. The <i>concierge</i> who had identified him as the
murderer, had discreetly gone on a vacation; but Hugh
had gathered dubious details of what had happened.
About ten o’clock the assassin had mounted to the old
man’s room. The <i>concierge</i> had seen him enter, but had
not seen him leave. About midnight the occupant of the
room below, a Casino employé, had heard groaning; but
by the time the door had been opened the old man was
dead. He was lying face downward in a pool of blood with
a knife stab just under the ribs. The safe was open and
empty; the room ransacked.</p>

<p>That was all Hugh could learn. It was vague and confusing
enough. The Monaco police seemed to be in no
hurry to clear up the mystery and probably would allow
it to swell the list of the Principality’s undiscovered
crimes.</p>

<p>Oh, for a word from Margot! He was growing anxious
about her. Then one day the postman handed him a
letter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span></p>


<h4>2.</h4>

<p>It bore the post-mark of Monaco. He tore it open and
read with amazement the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“My dear Cousin:</p>

<p>“You will no doubt be surprised at this manner of
address, but various things have led me to conclude that
the above relationship exists between us.</p>

<p>“My uncle was Gilbert Kildair, the well-known artist,
who, I find according to the records of the Municipality
of Menton, was duly married to Lucia Fontana on the
nineteenth of October, 1898.</p>

<p>“After his death she went to England to see if his family
would not do something for her and her son; but they
had quarrelled with him and refused to recognize her as
his wife.</p>

<p>“My mother was a Kildair, and struck by the curious
resemblance between us, I made inquiries with this result.</p>

<p>“I know that up to now your feelings towards me have
been hostile, but I hope that in view of our newly discovered
relationship, you will let byegones be byegones.
After all, blood is thicker than water, and already I feel
an interest in you that exceeds the warmth of ordinary
friendship.</p>

<p>“I would like you to visit me at my Villa. If it suits
you, my car will await you at ten this evening at the
Church of St. Devoté. Do run you up. Please do not
fail me.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">“Your cousin,</span><br />

“<span class="smcap">Paul Vulning</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p>Hugh had to read this extraordinary letter over three
times before he understood the significance of it. To his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
amazement succeeded disgust. He had no desire to be related
to Vulning. His dislike for the man was invincible.
There was also his resentment towards his father’s family.
He did not want to have anything to do with them. They
had refused to recognize his mother, and had never shown
the slightest interest in himself. Vulning was typical of
them, arrogant, selfish, supercilious. Why then this sudden
interest on his part? Why did Vulning recognize him
now, want to take him up? Hugh was puzzled.</p>

<p>He decided to go to Vulning’s villa; there could be no
harm in that. He might gain some information about his
parents. He did not like Vulning any the better now that
he knew he was a cousin. Still there was no reason
they should not be decently civil to one another.</p>

<p>He was glad to learn that his father had been a well-known
artist. That accounted for his own modest talent
and his joy in playing with colours. His mother ...
his poor mother ... perhaps she was one of the Fontanas
of Monaco, the famous Fontanas. He must go over
to Menton and look up the register. The letter suggested
to him new and engrossing lines of thought. He awaited
the evening with impatience.</p>

<p>At ten o’clock the carmine car was waiting, breathing
softly, with great glowing eyes. The chauffeur touched
his hat and Hugh leapt into the seat beside him. How he
loved a car! This was a Hispana Suiza and the one-eyed
chauffeur drove like a demon. He climbed the steep serpentine
hill, nursing his motor with infinite delicacy.
The engine roared triumphantly; the lights of the
town fell away; the world widened gloriously. They rose
with a steady, panting urge, toward the mountains and
the stars.</p>

<p>Soon they were well in the belt of orange groves and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
the road became more difficult to follow. The chauffeur
was driving at a slow pace, the way twisting and turning.
Hugh could hardly believe that any one lived in such a remote
place until he remembered that Vulning’s villa was
the highest on the hillside. It was ideal for any one
who loved seclusion; the view must be superb. Presently
lights swooped towards them, and the wheels of the car
ground in the gravel. They had arrived.</p>

<p>There is always something mysterious about the approach
to a lonely house at night. The sense of mystery
at Vulning’s villa was heightened by the great garden that
encircled it. The vast velvety blackness, with its suggestions
of pines and cyprus, and its rich sullen silence was
almost aggressive. Against the mountain the tall house
loomed faintly. It was terraced on three sides, with a
flight of steps leading up to the front entrance.</p>

<p>As he mounted them the door opened and a man
awaited him. Hugh was surprised to see it was Bob
Bender. Bob smiled in his sly, deprecating way.</p>

<p>“How are you, sir? Mr. Vulning’s expecting you.
He’s in the library. Come this way.”</p>

<p>He led Hugh down a long unlighted hall and halted
before a door. The air was stale and heavy.</p>

<p>Then the door was opened and Hugh found himself in
a large sombre room, panelled in dark wood; over what
appeared to be a bay window hung heavy crimson curtains.
The window was evidently open, as the curtains
trembled slightly. By an oak table in the middle of the
room stood Vulning with a curious smile on his face.</p>

<p>As the two men faced one another the resemblance between
them was more striking than ever. Both were tall
and slim and straight. Both had the severely regular
features of the type that used to be known as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
the English governing class. Their hair was of the same
light chestnut and brushed smoothly back. But while
Hugh’s eyes were black, those of Vulning were blue;
while Hugh’s face was frank and boyish, that of Vulning
was cynical and blasé. There appeared to be a dozen
years of difference in their ages.</p>

<p>For a moment there was an awkward pause, then Vulning
held out his hand with a rather exaggerated cordiality.</p>

<p>“Come on, now, be cousinly. I know you are prejudiced
against me; but, hang it all, I’ve suffered more
at your hands than you have at mine. Let’s forget it,
bury the hatchet, shake hands. Come, be a good sport.”</p>

<p>Hugh complied reluctantly. Cousin or not he could
not overcome his repugnance to this man.</p>

<p>“You were doubtless surprised,” Vulning went on
pleasantly. “I was, too, when I made the discovery.
It was our mutual friend, Mrs. Belmire, who put me
on the track. It is really a very curious coincidence.
However, we won’t dwell on that. I asked you up here to
speak about quite another matter. Won’t you sit down?
You’ll find that arm-chair quite decent.”</p>

<p>Hugh took it, but Vulning remained standing.</p>

<p>“Now,” he continued, “I am afraid I am going to surprise
you a second time. To make a long story short, a
few days ago there came into my hands, in a round-about-way,
certain documents with which you are doubtless familiar.
It was with regard to these I wanted to see you.
Look....”</p>

<p>With that Vulning extracted from the inside pocket of
his coat a rolled mass of manuscript, and laid it on the
table, keeping his hand on it.</p>

<p>“You know this, eh?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>Hugh was speechless. He sat staring at the document.
The cover had been torn away, but he recognized it at
once.</p>

<p>“The system of Professor Durand,” he gasped.</p>

<p>“Precisely. It’s all here. It was taken from his safe,
and has come into my possession; how—I cannot for the
moment explain. Now what I want of you is this....”</p>

<p>Vulning bent forward eagerly, his eyes gleaming.</p>

<p>“You and I alone know of this. I have all the documents
that refer to the system, but I am forced to confess
I can do nothing with it. You, I believe, are the one man
who can decipher it. Now I want to propose a partnership
between us. You will translate this manuscript. We
will work the thing together. We will get a hundred million
francs out of the bank. We will share fifty-fifty.
That is generous,—too generous. But then we are cousins.
Well, are you on?”</p>

<p>Hugh sat as if transfixed, staring at the folio.
The sudden sight of it, combined with the impudence of
the proposal, quite took away his breath. Vulning
watched him keenly.</p>

<p>“Takes you some time to realize it. I told you I would
surprise you.”</p>

<p>Hugh started up. “But,” he cried, “these documents
do not belong to you. They were stolen. The professor
intended to leave them to me after his death. I was to
publish them. It’s a sacred trust. Here, give them to
me....”</p>

<p>He made a grab for the documents; but Vulning withdrew
them quickly, and at the same time jerked a small
revolver from his pocket.</p>

<p>“No, you don’t,” he sneered. “Stand back. I’ve got
you covered.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>“You’ve no right to these papers,” Hugh protested
hotly. “I’ll go and tell the police.”</p>

<p>“You’ll do nothing of the sort. Don’t be a fool. It’s
a fair offer I’m making you. You translate this and we’ll
work together. Come!”</p>

<p>“I refuse.”</p>

<p>“You refuse. You surprise me. An easy chance to
make fifty million francs. Think of all it means, man,—wealth,
luxury, beauty. We are getting it all legitimately
from an institution that deserves no better treatment.
Consider again. You’ll translate this?”</p>

<p>“I tell you; no!”</p>

<p>“May I ask why?”</p>

<p>“Because.... Look here, how did those documents
come into your hands?”</p>

<p>“Never mind. I told you we would not go into that.”</p>

<p>“You have some connection with this theft. You....”</p>

<p>Then a light burst on Hugh. The man for whom he
had been arrested—</p>

<p>“It was you who stole them.... And—Oh, my God! ...
you damned villain! It was you, you who murdered
Professor Durand.”</p>

<p>Vulning’s face went white; he seemed about to collapse.</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t,” he stammered. “Not that. I swear I
didn’t do that. Look here, I’ll be quite honest. I confess
I took the papers. The professor admitted me in
the dusk, thinking it was you. He was working, and the
safe was open. I asked to refer to the system, and he
brought it to me. Then he saw who it was. We struggled,
and I gave him a touch of chloroform, a mere touch,
not enough to harm him. When I came away he was
sleeping like a baby. I took the papers, closed the safe
and left very quietly. That’s all I know. He was found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
later, stabbed to the heart. I did not do it. I swear to
that.”</p>

<p>Aghast, incapable of action, Hugh stood staring at him.
Then as quickly as he had weakened Vulning recovered
himself, and started forward, tense, tigerish.</p>

<p>“I’ve told you too much,” he snarled. He covered
Hugh with his revolver.</p>

<p>“You dog! I hate you. You refuse to give up
what you know,—well then, there’s only one thing left,—to
make you. Ho! there.”</p>

<p>At his shout the door was thrown open. Bob Bender
and the one-eyed chauffeur rushed in.</p>

<p>“Quick. That rope in the corner! Tie him up.
Steady there, you young hound; or I’ll shoot.”</p>

<p>The chauffeur and Bob Bender threw themselves on
Hugh. In spite of Vulning’s threat, he struggled fiercely.
It was not until the chauffeur had pinioned and tripped
him that he fell heavily. The three men held him down,
and trussed him so that he could not move. He lay helpless,
gazing up at them and panting painfully.</p>

<p>“Ah,” said Vulning, “that was hard. Let me get my
breath....”</p>

<p>He regarded Hugh malevolently. As he lit a cigarette,
his eyes were sinister in their cruelty.</p>

<p>“He refuses to do what we want, boys. There’s only
one thing left, regrettable though it is; we’ve got to
make him. Prop him up against the wall.”</p>

<p>They did so. Hugh glared at them.</p>

<p>“Go on,” he gasped. “You murdered the professor.
Murder me too.”</p>

<p>“I think we’ll get what we want out of you without
that,” said Vulning. “Close that window, Bob. He’ll
probably scream. Charlot, you know your job.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>What were they going to do? Hugh’s eyes followed
them fearfully. He watched Bob Bender go to the window
and remain some moments fumbling at the latch. He
saw the villainous-faced chauffeur leave the room and return
with a pair of powerful pincers in his hand. Meanwhile
Paul Vulning sat down on the edge of the table and
inhaled his cigarette. He was evidently enjoying the
scene and proposed to play with his victim as a cat does
with a mouse. Well, Hugh resolved, he would not cry
out whatever happened. At least Vulning should not get
that satisfaction from him.</p>

<p>The chauffeur caught Hugh’s hand, and, gripping the
end of his thumb with the pincers, began to squeeze.
Hugh felt the nail crack. The pain was excruciating.
His breath came quick; his eyes started from his head.
He choked back his groan of agony. Vulning was grinning
now, the grin of a devil. It was that grin that nerved
Hugh; not a sound passed his lips.</p>

<p>“Harder yet,” hissed Vulning. “Make him scream. Begin
on another finger. Get a good grip. Squeeze! Remember,
there are ten of them.”</p>

<p>He was carried away by a passion of cruelty and trembled
with a strange joy as he watched Hugh’s face. The
pain was so atrocious that Hugh almost fainted. Never
mind! They should not make him give in. They should
kill him first.</p>

<p>“Here, let me do it,” said Vulning. “You’re too easy.”</p>

<p>Hugh felt his nail bursting under the continued pressure.
He closed his eyes. His breath came in long gasps....</p>

<p>Then suddenly in that tense and thrilling silence he
heard a voice ringing out, high, harsh, metallic:</p>

<p>“<i>Hands up, all of you.</i>”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER SIX<br />


THE ESCAPE</h3>
</div>

<h4>1.</h4>

<p class="drop-cap">THE three swung round and jerked their hands
above their heads. A very tall man stood in the
doorway. He had a spade-shaped beard and
a coppery complexion. His hair of a glossy black was
brushed smoothly back from a long, retreating forehead.
His large nose was like the beak of a bird, and his black
eyes glittered. In his outstretched hands he held two
large automatic pistols. Hugh recognized to his amazement
the supposed Brazilian diplomat, Doctor Bergius.</p>

<p>“Keep your hands up, gentlemen,” said Doctor Bergius
warningly; and with a careless air he lowered his pistols
and entered the room.</p>

<p>At his heels trooped three others. The first, no other
than the dashing Italian Castelli, was in evening dress, but
handling his revolver as if accustomed to its use. The
other two were the most blood-thirsty pair of ruffians
Hugh had ever seen. One was huge and hulking, hairy
like a bear. A short beard almost covered his face, and
his hair, bristly as that of a worn scrubbing-brush, came
down to meet his bushy eyebrows. His companion was a
very small man, spare, active and hairy as a monkey,
with a lean and withered face and slit eyes that twinkled
with malice.</p>

<p>“Come on, Golaz,” said Doctor Bergius to the tall
ruffian. “You can look after the old fellow. Golaz, gentlemen,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
is my knife-man. In fact he used to be a pig-sticker.
He is rather an enthusiastic specialist. He’d as
lief cut your throat as look at you. Wouldn’t you,
Golaz?”</p>

<p>The ursine man grunted in a pleased way. He took out
a murderous-looking knife and going up to Bob Bender,
who was standing very straight, with his arms in the air,
made a playful pass with the knife across Bob’s scraggy
throat. A little spot of blood appeared. Bob shuddered.
Then Golaz gave him a little dig in the ribs
with the needle point of the knife. Bob shivered.</p>

<p>“Golaz is really an artist,” said the doctor. “I have
the greatest difficulty in restraining him. Now let me introduce
another of my pets. Advance, Gamba.”</p>

<p>The simian man came forward grinning.</p>

<p>“Gamba’s specialty is strangling,” explained Doctor
Bergius. “His work is slower but not less sure. Once
let him get those hairy hands of his around your throat,
and you’ll have to kill him to make him let go. You love
to get your fingers round a windpipe, don’t you, Gamba?”</p>

<p>Gamba grinned broadly, clutching and gripping with
his hands in a suggestive manner.</p>

<p>“All right, Gamba, you can account for the chauffeur.
As for you, Castelli, I leave you the Englishman. Now
that these preliminaries are all settled I can take a smoke.”</p>

<p>With a sigh of satisfaction Doctor Bergius sank down
in the big arm-chair and lit a cigarette.</p>

<p>“Ah,” he sighed again, “what would life be without the
soothing weed? You can have women and wine, Castelli;
I would not exchange them both for nicotine. This is a
comfortable den, Vulning; I feel quite at home already.
Ha! I see you have the papers there. Castelli, hand them
to me.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>The Italian took the system from Vulning’s hand and
gave it to the doctor.</p>

<p>“Thank you. I imagine it’s all here. Also ...” he
turned to Hugh, “it’s translator. Excellent. You know,
Vulning, you’ve given me a lot of trouble. We were both
on the same errand, only you went out by the door just
as I came in by the window. What a pity you closed that
safe. How was I to know it was empty? There I was
struggling to open it, when the old man woke up. Golaz
had to take his case in hand. The methods of Golaz are
not refined but they are effective. Well, now to business.”</p>

<p>Doctor Bergius turned over the leaves of the system.
“Here it is in my hands at last, the key that opens the
golden gates of wealth. I say, Vulning, I’m sorry for
you. You worked hard for this. I’m not such a bad chap
after all. I’m going to take you in with us. You and
Castelli can be on the same footing. The others can
rank with Golaz and Gamba. Do you accept?”</p>

<p>Vulning nodded sullenly; the other two with alacrity.</p>

<p>“Good. You may lower your hands. And now let us
come to this young man you have so beautifully bound,
and I fear, so sadly maltreated. Your methods are primitive.
I think I can show you a better way to make him
listen to reason. Golaz, bring in the girl.”</p>

<p>Hugh started. He had fallen forward; but, by turning
his head painfully, he could follow the movements of
Golaz. He saw the big cut-throat disappear into the hallway.
He heard a low moan and it seemed his heart forgot
to beat. With straining eyes he watched the doorway.
Yes, his worst fears were realized. Golaz entered with
Margot in his arms. Her hands and feet were tied; her
eyes closed, her hair streaming to the floor. She did not
seem conscious of what was happening.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>“Put her down,” said Doctor Bergius. “And now suppose
we begin by trying this instrument of torture on
those rosy little nails. It may be more effective with
our obstinate friend here. Golaz and Gamba, hold her.
Castelli, you can wield the pincers.”</p>

<p>But Castelli hung back. “No, Master,” he said with
a shrug, “I have no stomach for that. A man, yes! A
woman, well....”</p>

<p>“All right, Castelli. I know your softness of heart
where the weaker sex is concerned. Vulning, to you will
fall the honour.”</p>

<p>Again Paul Vulning took up the big pincers, and the
points closed over the girl’s thumb-nail. With a piercing
scream she opened her eyes.</p>

<p>“Hear that?” said Doctor Bergius to Hugh. “That’s
only a beginning. If necessary we’ll crack her ten little
nails like hazel nuts. Then if you don’t do what we want,
I’ll hand her over to Golaz and Gamba to work their will
on her. You know what that means. On the other hand
if you consent, if you tell us the meaning of all this, you
will both be well treated. You will perhaps be kept in
close confinement for a few weeks, but after that you will
be released. By then I hope we shall be ready to depart
with the spoil. Shall we begin again on the girl?”</p>

<p>Hugh shook his head. His face was stamped with horror.
“No, no,” he cried hoarsely. “I’ll do anything
you want.”</p>

<p>“That’s a sensible lad. Seat him at the table and release
his right arm. Vulning, have the goodness to fetch
me pen, ink and paper.”</p>

<p>Vulning brought them from a little card table that
stood in front of the bay window. Doctor Bergius rose
and bent over Hugh.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>“Now,” he said in his harsh metallic voice, “what we
want you to do is quite simple. You will put on that
paper all the symbols in those documents with their meanings.
After that we will shut you up while I make the
translation. If you forget anything and give me needless
trouble, I shall have to deal severely with you. Also
I will hold you responsible for the subsequent working of
the system. So you see I want you to take your task very
seriously. Now, go ahead.”</p>

<p>Hugh was placed facing the curtained window. He
took up the pen and began to write. Doctor Bergius
paced up and down. Every now and then he would look
at the document in his hand and then at the symbols Hugh
was writing. The page was soon covered with them.
Hugh strained his memory. Had he forgotten anything?
Were they complete?</p>

<p>As he paused for a moment, his brows pursed in thought,
the eyes of all were fixed on him. The doctor stood with
his back to the bay window, and as he struck a match to
light a fresh cigarette, he laid the precious documents
down on the little card table. Then in the tense silence
the striking of the match startled Hugh, and he glanced
up.... What was it he was seeing?... <i>Behind the
doctor a long sinewy hand was passing between the crimson
curtains. It reached towards the little card table; it
clutched the bundle of papers; it disappeared. But in
that swift moment Hugh saw that the little finger of the
hand was missing.</i></p>


<h4>2.</h4>

<p>The silence was almost painful. Hugh wondered how
long it would last. Suddenly Paul Vulning pointed to the
empty table with a cry.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>“The system! It has vanished.”</p>

<p>Swift as a flash Doctor Bergius looked down. Then
he rushed to the window.</p>

<p>“Quick,” he shouted, “I saw some one leap from the
terrace. All of you in pursuit. We must recover it
at all cost.”</p>

<p>He dashed out, Vulning, Castelli and the three others
following him. From the darkness Hugh heard shots
and much shouting.</p>

<p>“Scatter. Search the garden. Fire only if you’re
sure.”</p>

<p>They had all gone. He was alone with Margot. He
tried to see her, to go to her. He twisted around and
tumbled from his chair.</p>

<p>Could he believe his ears? As he lay face down he heard
a voice address him.</p>

<p>“Quick, sir. I’m goin’ to cut the ropes.”</p>

<p>It was old Bob Bender. He cut and slashed to such
good purpose that in a moment Hugh and Margot were
both free.</p>

<p>“There’s not a moment to lose,” whispered Bob.
“They’re hunting out in front but they may return any
minute. You must escape by the back. Come, I’ll
show you the way. Buck up, missy, you’ve got to make
an effort.”</p>

<p>Hugh supported the girl, and Bob piloted them along
the dark hallway. At the foot of a flight of stairs Bob
opened a door. The pure air of the mountain caressed
their faces.</p>

<p>“Take to the woods,” whispered Bob. “Climb high,
make a wide circle. I’ll slip back and get that paper you
wrote. Then I’ll join them in the hunt. Good luck to
you. Krantz is a wonder. The Casino is saved.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span></p>


<h4>3.</h4>

<p>Taking the girl’s hand Hugh led her through the darkness,
down a narrow flight of stone steps, and along a
steep pathway amid the shrubbery. He heard sounds of
the pursuit from the other side of the house and once the
sharp crack of a revolver. Once too, some one came panting
along the pathway towards them. He had scarcely
time to pull Margot into the deep shadow of the bushes
before a burly form pounded past. Trembling and terrified
the girl clung to him until the footsteps were drowned
in silence.</p>

<p>Once more he dragged her on. At the end of the pathway,
they came to a small door set in the high wall, secured
by a rusted bolt that at first resisted all his efforts.
Suddenly it shot back, and they found themselves on the
mountain side.</p>

<p>From the door a steep trail led to higher altitudes,
and up this he hurried her. Rocks tripped them, and
thorny bushes clutched at them, but spurred by fear they
stumbled on. Even when the tiny donkey-path faded out
and they found themselves on the raw and ragged flanks of
the mountain, they continued to climb and climb.</p>

<p>Several times he thought Margot was going to give out,
but a few words from him inspired her with a new
courage. In the last of these pauses he listened
acutely. The silence was absolute. They must be safe by
now. They had been climbing for nearly an hour. He
urged her to make one more effort, but she was unequal to
it and entirely collapsed.</p>

<p>Lifting her in his arms he carried her to where a huge
overhanging boulder formed a shallow shelter and laid
her down. Resting her head on his knee, he covered her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
with his coat. Then with his back to the rock he waited
for the daylight.</p>

<p>With the first brightening of the dove-grey sky he saw
that they had climbed further than he had reckoned.
They were on the slope beneath the Tete-du-Chien; above
them towered the great bluff, its beetling front steel grey,
stained with cinnamon, and around them, as if the greater
gods had pelted it in sport, huge boulders heaped in fantastic
confusion. Below them the olive groves were saturnine;
the roofs of the Condamine a sullen crimson,
and the sea’s immense tranquillity painted with a pale
fire.</p>

<p>He looked down at the white face, pillowed on shining
hair. Poor girl! How desperately exhausted she must
be. Her sleep had been troubled by fits of trembling; and
dry nervous sobs had awakened her half a dozen times.
He had soothed her with assurances of safety. He aroused
her gently and pointed to the brightening sky.</p>

<p>“Look!”</p>

<p>“But you are chilled through,” she said. “You are
shivering. You should not have given me your
coat.”</p>

<p>They rose stiffly, their faces haggard in the dawn.
Slowly and painfully they descended the mountain.</p>

<p>“What happened,” he asked, “that night?...”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I never understood. It was very late;
I heard a noise in the professor’s room and tried his door;
it opened. All was dark. There was a curious smell.
Again I heard a noise. I was afraid he was ill. I hurried
to his assistance. Some one caught me from behind, and
a hand covered my mouth. I struggled, but I had no
power. They bound and gagged me. Just as we were
going away one of them flashed an electric torch on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
floor. I saw the professor lying face downward. It was
horrible....”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know. They killed the poor old man. But
what after that?”</p>

<p>“A very strong man carried me in his arms; we descended
from the window by a rope ladder. Below they
had a closed-in car. We went up among the mountains,
before we stopped at a lonely house. They lifted me down,
and carried me to a room. I was locked in, a prisoner.
Oh, they treated me well enough. There was a peasant
woman who brought me my food and was kind to me. But
the time was long, for I was terrified, and so anxious
about you. I thought I should go mad. Then last night
they put me in the car again, and brought me down. You
know the rest.”</p>

<p>“What shall we do now? I suppose we had better go
back to our room.”</p>

<p>She shook her head. “Nothing can make me spend another
night there. The very idea horrifies me. No, I
want to go far away from here, very far. If you don’t
mind, I will get my things, stay at a hotel to-night, and
to-morrow morning leave for Paris.”</p>

<p>“I quite understand. But ... how about that cottage
at Villefranche? Won’t you come there with me?”</p>

<p>Again she shook her head. “No, not now....”</p>

<p>“Once you wanted to.”</p>

<p>“Once, yes. Once I had a dream.... That’s finished
now. I’ve been a foolish girl. I did lots of thinking when
I was alone up there, and I see my way clear. It’s a
lonely way but perhaps I’ll have my share of happiness.
Yes, I’d better go.”</p>

<p>He felt that she was right, and did not try to dissuade
her.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>“At any rate,” he said, “you’ll let me lend you that
money, the two thousand we had such a fuss over?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll borrow it gladly, and I’ll pay you back. I
bless you for all you’ve done for me....”</p>

<p>Next morning he saw her off at the station. As she
leaned from the window of a third class carriage she tried
hard to keep back her tears. He remembered their arrival
at this same station, and how he had followed her. He
would miss her painfully. A last handclasp and the train
bore her away. A loneliness came over him that was almost
a heartache.</p>

<p>“That ends another chapter,” he said to himself. “Perhaps
I’ll never see her again. Ah! little girl, may the
gods bless you and make you happy.”</p>

<p>And with that he went sadly away.</p>

AN INTERLUDE</h3>
</div>

<h4>1.</h4>

<p class="drop-cap2">ABOUT the end of May he bought the cottage
near Villefranche. It had pinkish walls that dripped
roses and a long generous garden dropping to
the beach. There he had a little boat pulled up on the
shingle and lay for long hours in its shadow, watching
the dreamy glimmer of the sea, and listening to the musical
plash of the waves. The velvet monotony of sea and
sky tranquilized his spirit.</p>

<p>He used to rise at four every morning, and work in his
garden through the cool hours; then go for a swim in the
bay, floating lazily on the milk-warm water, blinking at
the brightness of the sun. In the evenings he would fish
from his boat, pulling softly home in the starlight. He
became soaked with sunshine, as brown as any of his peasant
neighbours, and just as carelessly happy. He learned
to look on life with quiet eyes.</p>

<p>It was pleasant to think that he could go on like this
for twenty years. He needed so little; his garden supplied
him with fruit and vegetables, the sea with fish. By
selling some of his produce and keeping chickens and
rabbits, he could make the place self-supporting. He
had infinite time to dream and paint. If he painted patiently
and sincerely during twenty years surely he could
achieve something.</p>

<p>This was the future he sketched out for himself. One<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
thing was lacking; he missed Margot. If only she were
there, it seemed to him his happiness would be complete.</p>

<p>But she was back at work with Folette. She had taken
her old room again, the little mansard room, overlooking
the Boulevard Montparnasse. She wrote to him quite
often, and always that she was very happy.</p>

<p>Often as he lingered in his garden, he would look up and
imagine her standing in the doorway of the cottage in a
frame of roses. She seemed to complete the picture so
perfectly. What a pity she was not there. Well, one
can’t have everything. True, he might ask her to marry
him. But the idea of marriage dismayed him; it seemed so
irrevocable. Romance ended there, he told himself. He
was only twenty-three and a lifetime is long to spend with
one woman. An early marriage is a mistake, so every one
said. He missed her companionship awfully, but there!
... no doubt in time he would get used to the loss of her!</p>


<h4>2.</h4>

<p>It was curious how far away Monte Carlo seemed. Unfamiliar
mountains heaved up behind him; another topaz
hoop separated him from the gloomy rock and the
glittering point. Sometimes he would sail his little boat
far out, and from the shadow of his sail, watch the
poisoned paradise. It seemed to him like a dream picture,
rising in terraced beauty from the azure of the sea.
The Casino glittered like a heap of jewels, and the mountains
brooded in violet abstraction. All was loveliness,—creamy
beach and cradled harbour, palms and olive groves,
snowy villas gleaming in green gardens, and shining slopes
of pine. He gazed at it with rapture,—then shuddered at
the thought of all that lay behind.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>For Monte Carlo may be all things to all men, the most
adorable spot in the world or the most hateful. And to
him, filled with the moral strength that is born of peace,
the place was increasingly detestable. Its beauty was the
fatal beauty of a glorious courtesan, its people parasites
living on the folly and depravity of mankind. From
prince to page-boy they were dependent on that great
temple of chance into which poured streams of gold from
all the world. Its white range of palaces were to him
the symbol of all that was weak and wanton in human
nature.</p>

<p>As he sat in the shadow of his sail he recalled them all
so plainly, the spendthrift and the starveling, the derelict
and the degenerate, swirling round in the eternal circle
of that greater wheel which symbolizes the whole, unable
to extricate themselves, being drawn nearer and nearer to
that vortex which is ruin.</p>

<p>He detested it all now and saw it with other eyes. He
had escaped its lures. Never again would he set foot in
its polluted halls.</p>

<p>Then one day a shadow fell across his path and looking
up he saw Bob Bender.</p>


<h4>3.</h4>

<p>Bob, rusty and creaky as ever, looked singularly out of
place in his radiant garden.</p>

<p>“Excuse me, sir,” he said, rubbing his hands together
with a rasping sound, “for interruptin’ your horticulturous
provocations.”</p>

<p>“Not at all. Glad to see you.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir. You’ve got a tidy sorto’ place ’ere.
Now if I was you I’d bank up that celery a little more,
an’ them artichokes want cuttin’ back. Awful things artichokes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>
is to grow on you, if you gives ’em a chance.”</p>

<p>“What do you know about gardening?”</p>

<p>“Most all there is to know, I expect, considerin’ that I
was once in that way myself. Indeed I ’opes some day, if
ever I can scrape up enough money, to buy a little place
I know out ’Ampstead way. But there, I didn’t come
’ere to talk of gardens; I came over on quite another matter.
Krantz sent me.”</p>

<p>“Krantz!”</p>

<p>“Yes. You see that Doctor Bergius ’as got something
up ’is sleeve. We can’t quite make ’im out. ’E’s a great
one, ’e is. There ain’t a greater international crook on
the Continent to-day. ’E was ragin’ mad because Krantz
got the system away from ’im, and now ’e swears ’e’ll
get even, and do the Casino one in the eye.”</p>

<p>“That reminds me,” said Hugh. “What happened that
night after we got away?”</p>

<p>“Oh, they thought you’d got at a knife with your free
’and and cut the ropes. I joined the chase and ’eaded
’em in the wrong direction. You see my bein’ with Vulning
was an idea of Krantz’s. He suspected that Vulning
’ad the papers and got me to approach ’im. I pretended
I’d fallen out with Krantz; and after a bit Vulning
told me ’e ’ad the papers. It was me suggested ’e
get you to translate ’em. Krantz was to come to your
rescue. But we didn’t bargain on the other gang. However,
it came off all right.”</p>

<p>“What do you want of me now?”</p>

<p>“Well, you see, I’m no longer in the confidence of that
crowd. The doctor distrusted me from the first. There
was the business of the window for one thing. Why didn’t
I ’appen to fasten it properly? Anyhow they won’t ’ave
anything to do with me now; and I can’t get to the bottom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>
of the game they are playin’. But I do know they are
’avin’ an important meetin’ to-morrow at Vulning’s villa.
It’s at two o’clock. There will only be Vulning and the
doctor and Castelli. Now we were thinkin’ if we could
get Vulning out of the way, and you could take his
place....”</p>

<p>“What!”</p>

<p>“It’s really very simple, sir. You see you’re so extraordinary
like ’im any way. Just a touch of make-up
and you’d be perfect. We’ll give you a key to the villa
and you can change into some of ’is clothes and receive
the other two in the library. You can close the curtains
and darken the room. Then you’ll deceive them, ’ear their
plans and let us know.”</p>

<p>“But I’m risking my life.... If these fellows suspect,
they’ll shoot me like a dog.”</p>

<p>“It’s true there’s a lot of risk; but Krantz says ’e’ll
pay you ten thousand francs if you get the information
’e wants.”</p>

<p>“I’d rather not. I swore I’d never set foot in the Principality
again.”</p>

<p>“Krantz says that, if ever ’e asked a favour of you,
you promised you’d do it.”</p>

<p>“That’s true.... Well, tell Krantz ... I’ll do it.”</p>

THE PLOT</h3>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="drop-cap">“CHER COMERADE:</p>

<p>There is something which weighs on me and
of which I have been trying to write to you
since several days.</p>

<p>You have heard me speak of Florent Garnier. Twice
has he asked me in <i>marriage</i>, and a week ago he sought me
out and demand me for the third time.</p>

<p>He is more prosperous than ever. He has a grand
auto, and a villa near the forest of St. Germain. On
Sunday with Jeanne we drive out to see it, and it is truly
charming. Only he says he is so lonely there all by himself....</p>

<p>What am I to do? I think I am the most unhappy girl
in all Paris. It is a great chance for me, and Madame
Folette, Jeanne and the girls tell me I am crazy to refuse.
Which is quite true because I am all alone in the life....</p>

<p>I do not ask your advice because I know you will tell
me to take him too, and I don’t like when you do that.
All the same I thing you are right, and this time it is for
the best that I shall tell him.... <i>Yes.</i></p>

<p>I hope you are well, and happy, and think of you very,
very often.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">Votre petite soeur adoptée,</span><br />

<span class="smcap">Margot</span>.</p>

<p>Florent wishes we marry on the seventeenth September
so that in that day you must think of me and wish me
happiness.”</p>
</div>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>It was quarter past one when Hugh received this letter;
it was half past when he jumped into the carmine car and
told the chauffeur to drive him to Vulning’s villa.</p>

<p>“Keep to the blind side of that chap and he’ll never
know you,” Bob Bender had said. “What with Vulning’s
coat and hat and them yellow glasses he’s wearin’ lately
any one would take you for his twin brother. The chauffeur’s
had one or two drinks too much anyway,—we’ve
seen to that. ’E’ll ’ave all ’is time taken up lookin’ after
’is car.”</p>

<p>“And Vulning?”</p>

<p>“We’ve got ’im safe. You see there’s a little girl he’s
been after for some time. Mrs. Emslie’s daughter wot
committed suicide. She’s workin’ as a nurse girl; but she
won’t ’ave anything to do with ’im. Well, we got ’er to
send ’im a note sayin’ she’d meet ’im at one o’clock in a
room in a certain ’otel that’s a bit out of the way. ’E
came all right; and, while he waited for her, we simply
locked ’im in. ’E’s there now, ’ammerin’ at the door and
ragin’ like a madman. We won’t let ’im out till you get
back.”</p>

<p>“I’m feeling nervous.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be afraid. With that touch of make-up you’re
as like ’im as two peas. You’ll fool ’em all right. ’Ere’s
a key to the front door. Now run and jump into the car
as if you were in a ’urry. Take this. It will steady
you.”</p>

<p>Hugh took the small flask of brandy that Bender
handed to him, walked quickly to the car and leaped in.
The chauffeur did not even look at him. He touched the
button that started the motor, moved into gear and the
car shot forward.</p>

<p>As Hugh left the town below him his uneasiness increased.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>
His excitement seemed to mount with the mounting
road, his heart pounded like the straining motor of the
car that bore him on. He took a pull at the brandy flask,
and felt better.</p>

<p>They were now among the olive trees and still climbing.
A sleepy quiet brooded around them. When they drew
near the solitary house Hugh wanted to leap out and
make for safety, but it was too late to draw back.</p>

<p>As the chauffeur drove the car around to the garage,
Hugh mounted the front steps and opened the door. A
rush of stale air met him. The hallway was dark and
dirty. Vulning did not seem to have a caretaker and
probably only slept there once in a while. The rooms leading
off the hall were shuttered and dark. Hugh went into
the library, threw back the shutters and unclasped
the window. The light leaped in like a wild thing. He
looked carefully out of the window. It gave on the
terrace with a balustrade about three feet high. Below
was the road leading to the garage, and beyond that
dense shrubbery. He closed the window without clasping
it, then drew the heavy curtains, plunging the room in
mysterious gloom.</p>

<p>Once more he went out into the unlighted hall. How
quiet and dark the house was! His footsteps awakened
echoes everywhere. He went upstairs to where a door,
slightly open, showed a chink of light. It appeared to be
Vulning’s bedroom. The bed was unmade, the room untidy.
He took off his overcoat and drew on a dressing-gown
he found lying over a chair. On the tiny table at
the head of the bed was a small automatic pistol. Seeing
that it was loaded, he put it into his pocket.</p>

<p>He felt horribly “funky,” but a glance in the mirror reassured
him. His sunburnt skin had been made up to resemble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>
Vulning’s sallow one; little crowsfeet were round
his eyes, and cynical lines about his mouth. His hair was
parted in the middle and brushed back like Vulning’s.
When he put on Vulning’s yellow glasses it would have
taken a very clever man indeed to detect the substitution.
If only his confounded nervousness would not give him
away! He wound a silk muffler around his neck, noting
as he did so how his hands trembled. That would never
do! He took another big swig at the brandy flask.
Courage glowed in him, even to the point of recklessness.
He was ready to go down and face them.</p>

<p>As he descended the stairway somewhat unsteadily he
saw that his guests were already awaiting him. How
quietly they had come in! He had not heard them.
Golaz and Gamba were in the hall and glowered at him
with fierce and restless eyes as he passed. In the darkened
library Castelli and the doctor were talking in low tones,
bending over the table on which lay a large plan. They
turned as he entered.</p>

<p>Hugh shivered as he shook the large hairy hand of
Doctor Bergius. How he hated this man. Those deep
set eyes were profound with cruelty; that dense blue-black
beard concealed a face that might be that of a fiend
incarnate; his large fleshy lips of a bright unnatural red,
set in that black beard, gave a singularly repulsive impression.
When he smiled it was with a grin, callous, relentless,
orientally cruel.</p>

<p>He smiled now, and Hugh was glad of his yellow goggles.
They concealed the fact that his eyes were black
instead of blue. He was glad, too, of the drawn heavy
curtain. It seemed to him that even with all his precautions
Doctor Bergius was regarding him with a curious
fixity.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>“Ah, young man,” he said in his metallic voice, “you
have kept us waiting. There is so much to be done and
we have so little time. Castelli, close that door.”</p>

<p>Hugh nodded sullenly. He dared not trust himself to
speak. Once again Doctor Bergius regarded him curiously.
He did not seem satisfied. He went up to Hugh
and stared at him very hard. Hugh’s heart began to
thump.</p>

<p>“I am discovered,” he thought, and his hand went to
his pistol.</p>

<p>But the Doctor turned away with an expression of
contempt. “Pah!” he said. “You’ve been drinking again.
I hope you’re not off on one of your bouts.”</p>

<p>Hugh shook his head. He affected a certain surly stupidity.
“No, no, doctor,” he said thickly, “only a touch
of brandy. Got sore throat. Caught a chill on the golf
course. Felt shaky. Took it to steady me, clear my
head.”</p>

<p>“Well, it must be the last until to-morrow evening.
After that you can go to the devil your own way. Promise
me that now,—the last.”</p>

<p>Hugh nodded sulkily.</p>

<p>“That is understood. Your part in the programme is
a small one, but important. You must have all your
wits about you. If you fail you may throw out the whole
plan.”</p>

<p>“All right. I’ll keep off the stuff.”</p>

<p>“Good. Now to business. Look!... Here’s a plan
of the Casino.”</p>

<p>Hugh showed an eager interest. In order to see it better
he edged round to the side of the table nearest the
window. He had Doctor Bergius on his right, on his left
Castelli. The plan showed the entire ground floor of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>
Casino, the different rooms, the entrances, the windows,
even the tables. Here and there were traced lines and
figures in red, with names in Italian.</p>

<p>“You already have an idea,” went on Doctor Bergius,
“of what the great plan is. It is something unheard of,
unthought of, magnificent in its audacity. Only a man
of genius could have imagined it, perfected it in all its detail.
Only one man living could have done it. That man
is myself. It is what the Americans call a ‘hold-up.’
<i>We propose to hold-up the Casino.</i>”</p>

<p>Here the doctor paused to give effect to his words,
then continued:</p>

<p>“To do that, you realize, is a project of the greatest
gravity. But I have arranged everything; and it should
go like clockwork. In the first place we need lots of men.
I have a band of about sixty, all desperate characters, recruited
from the slums of Genoa. They are supposed to
be a touring athletic club, all wear the same caps and
ties. You may have noticed some of them already. They
have been here for some days and have visited the Casino
in the morning when it is open to all visitors. Besides
this we have secured admission cards for about a score of
them. They know the ground. Every man has his part
and is drilled in it. Each is of proved and desperate
courage, will carry two six-chambered revolvers, and
know how to use them. Ah, my friend, it is a marvellous
conception. You should have been present at our rehearsals.”</p>

<p>“What is my part?”</p>

<p>“Your part, my dear Vulning, is very simple. We have
got a day ticket for you in the name of a Swedish gentleman.
You will wear a heavy blonde beard and be completely
disguised. This is for your sake. You see with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>
what consideration we treat you. At six o’clock in the
evening you will enter the Casino. That is the hour of
affluence when all the tables are working, and the visitors
have left their money behind. There should be several
million francs in sight.”</p>

<p>Here the doctor paused and rubbed his hands crisply.</p>

<p>“But before going any further, I will explain my ideas
as to the division of the spoil. Each of our men has been
promised five thousand francs. For that they would risk
their lives a dozen times. Golaz and Gamba are to have a
hundred thousand francs each. You and Castelli will
have five hundred thousand. I will be modestly contented
with whatever is left. Is that understood?”</p>

<p>Castelli nodded. Hugh followed suit.</p>

<p>“Agreed. Now, Vulning, for your <i>rôle</i>! You enter the
Casino, I say, at six o’clock precisely, disguised as a
Swede. You go straight to the table next to the refreshment
room. It has been arranged that a man will rise
and give you a place. You will sit for a few minutes, then
suddenly, ...” the doctor paused, and took from his
pocket a revolver, “you will rise to your feet. You will
take this from your pocket, and, holding it to your head,
you will fire.... Ah! my friend Vulning, don’t start. It
will only be loaded with a blank cartridge. It will do you
no harm. Then having fired you will collapse and slip
under the table. That’s all you have to do for five hundred
thousand francs. Easy, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“And what happens then?”</p>

<p>“What happens then?...” Doctor Bergius raised
both hands exultantly. “Ha! I will tell you. That is
the signal. Every one in the rooms will hear the shot
and rush to the table. You know them. They will crowd
around and push and jostle. They will want to get a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>
glimpse of the suicide. There will be a mob. The attendants
will be making frantic efforts to get out the body.
Every one’s attention will be distracted.... Then it is
that things will <i>begin</i> to happen.”</p>

<p>Doctor Bergius grew more and more impressive.</p>

<p>“We will have a dozen of our own men in the small
room with the Opium Dream on the ceiling. Behold! it
will be empty but for them. Every one else will have run
to see the suicide. Only the croupiers will have remained
at their posts. Everything will be easy. Six of our men
will hold up the croupiers while the others throw open the
windows. If you remember, there are four windows giving
on the terrace near the band-stand. My men will be
waiting down below. They will swarm up. To protect
them I will have a cordon of men running down to the
sea. There I will have waiting also two very fast steam
launches.”</p>

<p>The doctor seemed to see it all. He spoke as a man inspired.</p>

<p>“After that it will be easy. A rush, a great drive. We
will sweep them all before us. They will be like frightened
sheep. Think of it! There will be forty of us all armed
to the teeth. Can’t you see them flying before us? We
will herd them all into the refreshment room. Castelli with
twenty men will control the main rooms; Golaz with ten
men will take the long room that gives on the terrace;
Gamba with another ten will attend to the <i>salon privé</i>.
We will shoot down any one that shows the least sign of
resistance. There will be panic, confusion, terror. We
will pen the croupiers in corners at the revolver’s point.
Castelli, Golaz and Gamba will run to the tables and
scoop the big notes into bags. We only want the big
bills.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>“Hold on!” said Hugh. “What about the mechanism
that automatically locks the coffers?”</p>

<p>“We’ve seen to that. An electrician in our pay has
put it out of action. Everything has been thought of.
In five minutes it will all be over. We will then gather in a
band under the big dome, fire a final volley over the heads
of the crowd and beat a retreat. Then we will drop from
the windows, run to the beach, tumble into the waiting
launches and ho! for Italy. It will all be over before any
one realizes what has happened. Magnificent, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“And what about me?”</p>

<p>“Ah, my dear Monsieur Vulning, do not worry about
your precious self. Yours is the easiest part to play.
You will, of course, beat a retreat with us. We will put
you ashore at St. Remo if you wish. You can then remove
your disguise and return here. No one will even suspect
you....” Again Doctor Bergius looked at him
curiously.</p>

<p>“I believe you are a coward, Vulning. Look here,
Castelli will go through your part just to show you. I
have here some blank cartridges. See! I charge the revolver.
Now, Castelli....”</p>

<p>Castelli stood up by the table. He held the revolver
about three feet from his head and fired. Then he dropped
to the floor and remained there, grinning up at Hugh.</p>

<p>“<i>Voila</i>,” said the doctor. “That’s all. No risk for you.
You lie snug under the table and watch events. Easy,
isn’t it? Ah, the whole conception is superb, the work of
a man of genius.... <i>Listen!</i>...” The doctor stopped
suddenly, grew tense, alert. “What’s that? Who’s
out there with Golaz and Gamba?”</p>

<p>Hugh, too, was listening. He heard excited voices and
steps coming down the hall. He trembled and as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>
reached out for support his hand touched an inkwell made
out of the fuse of an old German shell. The next instant
the door was flung violently open and a man entered.</p>

<p>It was Paul Vulning.</p>

THE HOLD-UP</h3>
</div>

<h4>1.</h4>

<p class="drop-cap">“HOLD him! Hold the impostor!” cried Vulning.</p>

<p>Hugh dashed the brass inkwell at the head
of Doctor Bergius. The doctor collapsed over
the table. Castelli, who was still on the floor in a crouching
position, clutched at Hugh’s leg. Hugh launched a
vicious kick and caught him on the jaw. With one bound,
he was behind the crimson curtains, and out on the terrace.
He leaped the balustrade and plunged into the shrubbery.
Madly he tore on. About fifty yards away was a high
wall. He leaped at it desperately. His hands just
clutched the coping, and he hung, slipping and scraping,
feeling for a foothold. Then his toe caught in a tiny projection,
and in another moment he had drawn himself up.</p>

<p><i>Spat! Spat!</i> went the plaster of the wall.... They
were firing at him as they ran. Golaz and Gamba came
plunging through the bushes. They were appallingly
near. The top of the wall was covered with bits of broken
glass that caught his dressing-gown, as he leaped down
on the other side. As he tried to wrench it free, a
brown hand reached over and gripped it. With a twist
and a turn, Hugh wriggled out of it. His pistol fell from
the pocket. He snatched it up and rushed on.</p>

<p>A few yards further he darted behind an ancient olive
tree and looked back. Gamba was already astride of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>
wall. Hugh fired twice and he saw the man drop back.
Then he ran blindly on, taking the terraces of olive trees
in reckless leaps, often landing on his knees. At
length he came out on the mountain side amid boulders
and prickly scrub. He dodged among the rocks, and
cowered behind the bushes. He was torn and bleeding in a
dozen places, and his clothes were in shreds. Presently
he sank exhausted.</p>

<p>For over an hour he lay without moving. Everything
was quiet; they had evidently given up the pursuit. He
rose and by a round-about route he made his way back to
the Casino.</p>

<p>Bob Bender was waiting for him on the steps. He
looked anxious and excited. He dragged Hugh through
a side door.</p>

<p>“Quick! tell me what’s happened. You’re in a hell of a
state. We were afraid they’d got you.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you know?... Vulning has escaped.”</p>

<p>“No!”</p>

<p>“Yes, he arrived at an awkward moment for me. I’ve
had to jolly well risk my life for your people.”</p>

<p>“Vulning must have got out by the window. It was
over thirty feet from the ground. We never thought of
guarding that. He must have made a desperate effort....
Well, did you discover anything?”</p>

<p>“All.”</p>

<p>“The devil! Quick! Tell me. How pleased the chief
will be!”</p>

<p>“There’s a hold-up of the Casino planned for to-morrow
night.”</p>

<p>“A hold-up!”</p>

<p>“Yes. They’ve got over sixty gunmen. Vulning’s to
give the signal by shooting himself with a blank cartridge.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span>
The men are to swarm up by the windows of the small
room facing the band-stand. They have two fast steam
launches to make their getaway in.”</p>

<p>“It was planned for to-morrow at six, you say?”</p>

<p>“To-morrow at six.”</p>

<p>“They’ll never try it now. We’ve got them beaten,
thanks to you. It has taken you a long time to get
here.”</p>

<p>“Over two hours.”</p>

<p>“More. Look, it’s nearly six now.”</p>

<p>“I had to make a big detour to avoid them.”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s no time to lose. They may try to-morrow
after all; we must be prepared. Oh, won’t the chief
be pleased! We must try to find him. He’s in the Casino
somewhere. He has many disguises. Come....” Bob
peered everywhere, but could see no sign of Krantz.</p>

<p>“Let’s look at the windows they mean to swarm up,”
suggested Bob. The two men pulled aside the yellow
blinds and looked down. The ledge was broad and the
height not great.</p>

<p>“Easy enough,” commented Bob. “By getting into the
band-stand a dozen men could command the whole terrace.
The plan’s been well considered, but we’ll fix it so as it
can never be carried out. We’ve got you beaten, Mister
Bergius.... God! What’s that?”</p>

<p>Hugh looked to where Bob was pointing. On the calm
sea, lying close in, were two long steam launches. They
manœuvred up and down, until they were hidden by the
terrace.</p>

<p>“Did you see them, or did I dream?”</p>

<p>“No, it’s them ... <i>them</i>!”</p>

<p>A sudden fear seized Bob Bender. He looked up at the
clock.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span>“Just on the stroke of six. If only Krantz were here.
I wonder....”</p>

<p>The two men stared at one another, and even as they
stared, a sudden shot rang out.</p>

<p>Bob Bender gripped Hugh by the arm and cried
hoarsely: “Hear that! the signal! <i>They’ve advanced
the time by twenty-four hours. If I’m not mistaken the
‘hold-up’ is now on.</i>”</p>


<h4>2.</h4>

<p>They turned swiftly. The people at the table had
left their places, and grabbing their stakes, were running
in the direction of the sound. Only the croupiers sat still.
These looked at one another in a rather uncomfortable
way.</p>

<p>“Come,” said Hugh, “I want to see if it’s really Vulning.”</p>

<p>He ran after the others. The crowd was so dense, it
was impossible to get near the victim. Hugh saw the
lackeys struggling to extricate a limp form from under
the table. The faces of the crowd wore a mixture of
curiosity and awe; they pushed and jostled shamelessly,
to get a glimpse of the suicide. The inspector, the floor
director and the director of games hurried to the scene.
It had been a long time since a suicide had taken place
at the tables. It would make a nasty scandal.</p>

<p>“<i>C’est tres embetant</i>,” Hugh heard one of them say.
He saw a lackey arrive with a black sheet to cover the
corpse. Then a woman pushed her way out of the
crowd; she was in a hysterical state.</p>

<p>“I saw him do it,” she cried. “I was sitting beside him.
It was a big blonde man, a Swede, I think.”</p>

<p>“Look!” said Hugh, suddenly gripping Bob’s arm.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span>
“It’s true. There they come.” Almost simultaneously
there were a dozen revolver shots, and a bunch of
croupiers tumbled from the smaller salon, their hands in
the air, their faces sick with fear.</p>

<p>“This is no place for me,” said Bob Bender. “They’ll
shoot me at sight. I’m willing to work for the Casino,
but I’m not willing to lose an inch of my skin for them.”</p>

<p>Bob disappeared and not a moment too soon. Hell
seemed to have broken loose. With a rush and a roar
a score of men burst from the small salon. They whooped
as they ran, brandishing revolvers and firing in the air.
Their swarthy faces were lit by the savage joy of combat.
They drove every one before them; if a croupier showed
a sign of resisting he was felled with the butt of a heavy
revolver. But few of the croupiers resisted; most of them
ran like rabbits, diving under the tables.</p>

<p>All was pandemonium. Women shrieked and fainted;
there was a general struggle to get to the doors. Hugh
could not move; he was wedged in a mob of players who
fought and roared and cursed, as they backed away from
the bandits.</p>

<p>Then in the midst of the mad tumult, hushing and
dominating it, a harsh metallic voice rang out. “There
is no danger so long as no one resists. Go quickly, all of
you, and leave the rooms empty.”</p>

<p>It was Doctor Bergius. He was standing on the table
to the right, an automatic in either hand. Around his
head was bound a white bandage. Suddenly Hugh heard
a report near him. A croupier had put his hand on the
metal box where the big notes were kept; he collapsed instantly,
shot in the head by Castelli.</p>

<p>Hugh was forced with the crowd into the refreshment
room. He could still see swarthy ruffians pouring from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span>
the small salon and hear shrieks, shots, howls of excitement.</p>

<p>The centre of the Casino had been cleared, hundreds of
players had been driven into the atrium, hundreds of
others penned in the refreshment room. Doctor Bergius
still stood there, while Castelli and two others looted
the tables. The band that had worked the private
rooms came running back with their booty. They were
joined almost immediately by the gang that had been pillaging
the main rooms. With revolvers in hands, they
formed a solid mass, their eyes flashing, their teeth gleaming
ferociously. The voice of Doctor Bergius again rang
out:</p>

<p>“Stay where you are, all of you. We have men posted
to command the crowd. If one of you moves from his
place before a full ten minutes has passed he will be shot.
This is a solemn warning.”</p>

<p>The doctor leaped down, and his men followed him,
firing as they went.</p>

<p>Hugh edged through the crowd; he wanted to see what
was happening. The last of the rear guard had disappeared
into the smaller salon. Through the open doorway
he saw them descending by the window. No one had as
yet dared to move. Yes, there was <i>one</i>, a woman. Hugh
saw her run in from the atrium, and marvelled at her
daring. Then he recognized her. It was the tall woman
who always dressed in grey. As she crossed the threshold
of the small salon, she fired at the two men who
were balanced on the sill; they swung around and returned
the fire. Hugh recognized Castelli and the doctor. Then
they, too, disappeared and the woman in grey lay still on
the floor.</p>

<p>Everything was quiet, impressively quiet. The ten minutes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span>
were up but still no one was inclined to move. Hugh
was the first to break the spell. He ran across the empty
hall to the nearest open window. Two launches were
steaming away. All was over now. The grand <i>coup</i> had
been successful. When he turned back, the lackeys were
carrying the veiled woman into one of the private rooms.
Suddenly Hugh remembered the supposed suicide. He ran
into the grand salon. The body still lay under the table.
He bent down and examined it. It was Vulning; the false
blonde beard was crimsoned with blood, and his head was
blown open. The revolver had been loaded with a real ball.
The poor devil had put an end to his own life. Doctor
Bergius had seen to it that he had saved them his share
of the swag. What a joker the doctor was!</p>


<h4>3.</h4>

<p>Hugh was sitting in his garden the following afternoon
when Bob Bender came to see him. He counted out ten
bills of a thousand francs each.</p>

<p>“There! if we failed it was through no fault of yours.
You’ve earned this. Now we want you to go away for
awhile, disappear somewhere. We want to hush the whole
thing up, choke off all inquiries.”</p>

<p>“All right. By the way, what about that poor woman
who was shot?”</p>

<p>“Oh, she’s all right! They only winged her. She
dropped to avoid further injury. But then I shouldn’t
say ‘she.’ Do you know who that was?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Krantz.”</p>

<p>“The devil!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I was surprised myself. He’s been spying on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span>
gang for months. He’ll be all right in a few weeks.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad. I liked Krantz. I say, you don’t need to
be afraid of my blabbing anything. But I don’t see how
you are going to hush up a thing like that. How are you
going to account for it?”</p>

<p>Bob grinned.</p>

<p>“We’re giving out that it was the rehearsal of a cinema
production.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be hanged!... All right. I’ll make myself
scarce. I’ll shove off somewhere this very night.”</p>

<p>And three hours later he was on the boat bound for
Corsica.</p>

THE VALLEY OF THE GOLO</h3>
</div>

<h4>1.</h4>

<p class="drop-cap">IN the glimmer of early dawn, the big boat swung
slowly into the harbour. Under the lightening sky
the steel grey waters changed to steel blue; and the
dark mysterious land smiled into friendliness. The grey
cubes piled against the mountain brightened into tall
houses still locked in sleep. Presently, with a fore-glow
of citron, the clear rim of the sun cut the sea-line; and
the sea became jade green. The air was diamond pure;
the mountains took on colour; and Bastia awakened to another
careless day.</p>

<p>High caserne-like houses, massive-walled and stucco-fronted;
shabby shops half a century behind the times;
mustiness and age; cigarettes, vendetta knives, and goat-flesh,—these
were some of Hugh’s first impressions of
Bastia.</p>

<p>He found a room in a tall hotel near the upper end of
the town. It had vast rambling corridors with many
doors, none of which were numbered, and to find his room
he had to count each time the doorways from the head of
the staircase. The interiors of all the rooms were alike
in their simplicity. Each had high yellow walls, and a
ceiling painted with a design of flowers and fruit, a bed,
a <i>commode</i> with water-jug, two cane bottomed chairs.</p>

<p>Bastia soon bored Hugh. It’s streets seemed gloomy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[344]</span>
and sordid, its people sunk in tradition. There was nothing
to do. The first morning he wandered up and down
buying the numerous brands of local cigarettes. In
the afternoon he craved a cup of tea, but it seemed to be
unknown. Finally at a big café he found a brew which
tasted like <i>tisane</i>. A single gulp sufficed.</p>

<p>At his hotel the food was very bad. The place was run
on casual lines by a family of Corsicans, swarthy, hairy,
oily, with a suavity that signified nothing. At his
special request they procured him butter, but it looked so
much like axle-grease that he did not have the courage to
discover what it tasted like. At dinner he had a ragout
of very young lamb that tasted quite good, until the
smallness of the bones suggested to him that the lamb
had been still-born, then he ate no more.</p>

<p>In his overwhelming loneliness he thought that he would
write to Margot. He went to the so-called <i>salon</i>, dipped
a rusted pen hopefully into a dusty ink-bottle. Alas! it
was dry. Discouraged, he rose and sought the streets
again. A few cheap cinemas were open, the bills displaying
cowboy pictures,—strong, silent, wooden-faced men
and romping, sunny-haired heroines. The streets were
badly lighted and suggested nocturnal adventure; but the
frequent display of the vendetta knife in the shop windows
was an incentive towards virtue. He found a big,
dingy café, and, ordering a liqueur, fell to sampling one
after another the various brands of cigarettes he had
purchased. He was abysmally bored. Bastia was the
finest place in the world, he decided, to pass through
without stopping.</p>

<p>Then he went home to his hotel. Sitting on his bed in
the candlelight, he read his little guide-book. Suddenly
he had an idea. He was fit, foot-loose, free,—why not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[345]</span>
walk across the island? Yes, that was it. He would
tramp from Bastia to Agaccio.</p>


<h4>2.</h4>

<p>Next morning he bought a small, cheap valise and
packed in it the few clothes he needed, also his sketching
materials, as he might want to make some colour notes
on the way. He planned to take about a fortnight to the
trip, jogging along easily, studying the people, perhaps
fishing a little, and generally enjoying himself.</p>

<p>This cheerful prospect reconciled him to another day
in Bastia. He made the acquaintance of a tourist party
that were stopping at his hotel. They were nearly all
women, and their great subject of conversation was not
the beauties of the island but Food,—the feasts that
awaited them of fresh trout, black-birds and passionate
pink wine.</p>

<p>“Ah! you are English!” said a vivacious French girl to
Hugh. “There are so many English in Corsica, very
aristocratic English. They have been coming here for
years, and seem to think they have discovered the place.
They rather resent us ordinary tourists. There is another
Englishman in the hotel. Perhaps you have seen
him. He has the room next to yours. Or he may be an
American, he is so tall and clean-shaven, and he wears
those funny big round tortoise-shell spectacles. They
make people look like owls, I think. Do you know him?
I ask because he seems so quiet, so retiring. I am quite
curious about him.”</p>

<p>“No, I haven’t seen him. But then I haven’t been near
my room all day. If I see him I’ll speak to him, and
allay your curiosity about him.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[346]</span>That evening he passed the tall man in the gloom of
the corridor. Hugh was about to accost him when the
man brushed past him and disappeared hurriedly into his
room.</p>

<p>“Can’t be an American, after all,” thought Hugh, “or
he’d be more sociable. I’ll look up his name in the register.”</p>

<p>When he did look it up, he found it was Wilbur P.
Hoffmann, Jersey City; that settled it.</p>


<h4>3.</h4>

<p>The next morning, before starting out, he sought the
proprietor of the library where he had bought his guide-book,
and inquired the best road for his journey.</p>

<p>“But, monsieur,” said the man, “it would be better to
take the train to Cassamozza; it is very flat and uninteresting
as far as that. There the mountains begin, and
you go up the valley of the Golo. The train starts in
half an hour. You have just time to catch it, if you
hurry.”</p>

<p>The idea was a good one. Hugh hurried back to the
hotel, leaped up the two flights of stairs and burst into his
room. He grabbed his valise, which he had packed before
going out, and rushed down into the street. Within
ten minutes he was seated in the train.</p>

<p>The first class carriage in which he found himself was
very small and very dirty. He had to rub the windowpane
with a newspaper in order to see out. On the walls
of the compartment were advertisements of the wine of
Cap Corse, a local <i>apéritif</i>, and a liquor called Cederatine.
There were three other passengers in the carriage,
a fat, spectacled man and two thin, spectacled women.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[347]</span>
From their accent he thought they were German at first,
but later decided they were Dutch. They did not interest
him. When the train started he turned his attention
to the scenery. A green level stretched away to brown
marshes that in turn yielded to the grey of the sea. At
the tiny stations, sheltered by eucalyptus trees, peasants
laden with baskets got in and out. Hugh attached a
strap to the rings of his valise so that he could sling it
from his shoulder. He had packed it with bread, cheese
and fruit, a tin billy and a packet of tea.</p>

<p>He had decided to walk for two hours after reaching
Cassamozza, then lunch in the open, so that it was with a
sense of cheerful adventure that he descended at the
little station and started out on his long tramp. How
hot the way was! As he strode up the valley of the
Golo the sun was scorching, the road a dazzling white;
below him was a furious torrent, now dashing in dazzling
foam amid great boulders, now swirling greenly in
gravelly pools. It delighted him; it was so pure, so wild,
so free. There was the <i>maquis</i>, too. It rose on either
hand, clothing the mountain sides with rich dark green.
It was pathless, dense, the best cover in the world. Here
in the old days bandits had defied the forces of law
and order; but now, doubtless, they were all dead.</p>

<p>With every step he realized more and more that he
was advancing into the land of legend and history. He
passed a hoary shepherd, who might have stepped from
the pages of romance. The old man had a long beard and
was dressed in brown corduroy. On his head he wore a
picturesque <i>beret</i>, and strapped to his back was a huge
blue umbrella and a gun. He was leaning motionless on
his long staff, gazing over a flock of black-haired sheep
that mottled the hillside. Hugh felt the poetry of it—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[348]</span>
mountains soaring to meet the sky, the white torrent
roaring in his ears, the solitary shepherd, white-bearded
as a patriarch of old.</p>

<p>He was becoming hungry, furiously hungry, and he
thought with joy of the simple fare tucked away in his
valise. He climbed down to the river, and in the shadow
of a great rock made a cheerful fire of driftwood. Now
for the tea. Confound it! What was the matter with
his valise? His key refused to turn in the lock.</p>

<p>“That is the worst of these cheap bags,” he complained;
“the key always jams when you are in a devil of a
hurry.”</p>

<p>He was ravenously hungry. His mouth watered even
at the thought of bread and cheese. Damn the thing!
It was a pity to break the lock but there seemed no help
for it. Another effort. There, it was yielding. Bravo!
it had suddenly burst open.... Good God!</p>

<p>He stared blankly at what he saw. He rubbed his eyes
and looked again. No, he was not dreaming, he was not
mad ... they were there, dozens of them ... packets
tightly tied, neatly arranged, numbered.... <i>Thousand
franc bank-notes</i>. There seemed to be a hundred to a
packet, and there were twenty-eight packets. Nearly
three million francs! What could it all mean? Still
staring at the wealth in his possession, he sat down and
tried to think. The Golo roared in his ears. Between
two grim grey boulders it crashed; it swirled and eddied
into a great green pool. In those pure depths could be
seen the darting shadows of trout.</p>

<p><i>Three million francs!</i></p>

<p>He breathed the perfume of the <i>maquis</i>. He saw it
carpeting the broad valley, rising to the mountain ridges
that met the sky. Yonder like a carved figure the patriarchal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[349]</span>
shepherd stood motionless by his flock. It was
like a dream.</p>

<p><i>Three million francs.</i></p>

<p>Yes, there they were in that little valise. He looked
closely at it; it was not his valise. It was quite different
from the one he had bought, bigger and finer! He had
taken it by mistake. How could he have made such a
blunder? It had been in his room.... Or had it been
in his room? Ah! that was it. In his furious hurry to
catch the train he must have entered the wrong room....
But whose? Why, whose but the tall American’s; Wilbur
P. Hoffmann’s. Now he was getting at it. He had
rushed into the room adjoining his and carried away
the American’s valise. It was not such a strange thing
to do, after all. The rooms were all alike, the doors
unnumbered. He had not examined particularly his
valise when he had bought it; and it was little wonder
that he had not noticed the difference. Yes, he had
carried away another man’s valise containing nearly
three million francs. What should he do with it? Go
back to Cassamozza and telegraph, of course! The tall
American must be in a devil of a stew. But what was
Wilbur P. Hoffmann doing packing three million francs
around in a hand valise? It was a rum affair....</p>

<p>Hugh realized suddenly his own position. It was dangerous
to be carrying such a treasure in this wild, primitive
country. Few men would hesitate to kill him to gain
possession of it. Even now some one might be watching
him. Half fearfully he looked around. Then he closed
the valise with a snap. Some one <i>was</i> watching him. It
was a peasant lad who had bobbed up from the other side
of the big boulder.</p>

<p>“Hullo,” said Hugh.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[350]</span>“<i>Bon jour, monsieur.</i>”</p>

<p>The lad drew nearer. He carried a long cane fishing-rod
and had a canvas wallet slung at his back. He wore
an old army tunic on which was sewn the yellow ribband
of the military medal. He also limped badly. His age
was about that of Hugh, and his face was olive tinted
and bold featured.</p>

<p>“How is the fishing?”</p>

<p>“Not bad, monsieur. A little too clear. Still,
look....”</p>

<p>Opening his satchel he showed Hugh four fine trout.
Suddenly Hugh remembered that he was hungry.</p>

<p>“Listen,” he said, “I’ve walked from Cassamozza, and
I’ve forgotten to bring anything to eat. I’m dying of
hunger. I suppose it wouldn’t be possible to cook
these?”</p>

<p>“Nothing easier, monsieur. I generally cook a fish or
two for lunch. See....”</p>

<p>He took from his wallet a small frying-pan and a bottle
of olive oil.</p>

<p>“Already you have a fire made. We will cook these in
no time, and you will see how nice they will be.”</p>

<p>He soon had the fish simmering on the fire. He produced
a piece of coarse bread and even some salt. When
the fishes were cooked Hugh laid them on a flat stone.
He ate with his hands, stripping the bones with his fingers.
What matter! There was lots of water to wash in afterwards,
all the Golo a giant finger-bowl at his feet. He had
never tasted fish quite so delicious.</p>

<p>“There! I feel better,” he said at last. “Now for a
good drink at the river and a smoke.”</p>

<p>He produced cigarettes and the two smoked comfortably.</p>

<p>“Been at the War?” asked Hugh.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[351]</span>“Yes,” said the lad. “Verdun. I got wounded in the
leg there. It still bothers me. Two of my brothers were
killed. There’s not a family here but lost some one.
You know we Corsicans are brave. There were no braver
men in the French army than our regiments. But they
don’t like the Corsicans in France. The French generals
sacrificed us.”</p>

<p>He shook his head sadly.</p>

<p>“Ah! poor Corsica. It is the forgotten island. So
rich, yet so neglected. We are supposed to be savage,
but there is no people so kindly. But we are poor, oh,
so poor. Look at me. I have not a <i>sou</i>. And I will
always be like this, poor, ragged, ignorant. It is hard.”</p>

<p>“What would you do if you had ... say three million
francs?”</p>

<p>“Ah, monsieur, you jest. That is all the money in the
world. Why, I would buy my old mother the cottage she
lives in; then I would go to Paris and get an education.
I would live like a fine gentleman. Ah! Paris. I was
there once. What a time I had! I shall never forget it.
Well, now I must catch some more fish for our supper
this night.”</p>

<p>Hugh tried to give him a bill for five francs, but the
lad drew back proudly.</p>

<p>“No, monsieur, we are a hospitable people. We do
what little we can to make the stranger welcome. I
thank you, but I can accept nothing.” He limped away
in his rags and Hugh did not see him again.</p>


<h4>4.</h4>

<p>Once more Hugh climbed to the road. He would go
on, he decided, to the next station and telegraph there.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[352]</span>
What a beastly nuisance! He would have to return to
Bastia. That American, who was he? Even in that
brief moment in the corridor there had been something
vaguely familiar about him. What if he were a criminal
fleeing from justice! What if.... Good Heavens!...
Hugh stopped short as the great idea flashed on him.
Could it be?... Could it be that Wilbur P. Hoffmann
was....</p>

<p>He tore open the valise again, and fell to examining
the notes. Some pencil markings confirmed his suspicion....
Was it Doctor Bergius? Absurd! Yet why not?
Doctor Bergius with his beard shaved off, his head
cropped, would not look very unlike Wilbur P. Hoffmann.
He had noticed, even in the obscurity, the man’s large,
beak-like nose. Conviction grew on him. Yes, the tall
American was Doctor Bergius. Here now was a pretty
mess. What was he to do? The Casino had been robbed
of three million francs. He was alone with the booty
in the savage heart of Corsica; he could not return it
to the robbers, and to return it to the Casino ... hum!
That didn’t quite appeal to him either. He had not
much sympathy with the Casino. They could well afford
to lose it. It would be better to hand it over to some
deserving charity. In the meantime what was to be done?
He could not carry the stuff round. He must dispose
of it for the moment. That was it. He would hide it.
He had been hearing for some time, as he walked, the
roar of a great waterfall, and saw it about three hundred
yards further on at the head of a very wild and
solitary gorge. Climbing over the rocks, he reached the
base of the cliff where the white shaft of water plunged
into a deep pool. He found that the rock over which it
fell shelved back into a low cave. He crawled in; it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[353]</span>
quite dry. He took out the bundles of bank-notes, and
wrapping them in his waterproof coat, bound the parcel
tightly with stout cord. Then he crawled still further
into the cave and jammed it into a fissure of the rock.</p>

<p>“There! It’s safe,” he said. “It can remain in that
cleft a thousand years and no one will find it.”</p>

<p>He crawled out cautiously, and, after reconnoitring
to see that no one had observed him, continued on his
way.</p>

IN THE “MAQUIS”</h3>
</div>

<h4>1.</h4>

<p class="drop-cap2">AMID the gorges of the Golo the white road wound
on and up. The <i>maquis</i> encroached on it, frowned
on it shaggily. Once or twice Hugh plunged into
the perfumed cover and explored it for a few yards. The
landscape lay sunny and still.</p>

<p>On the other side of the road, all strength and joy,
the river leapt like a living thing; it charged the boulders,
it flashed in foam, it gleamed in green pools. Sometimes
he saw peasants with cane-poles tempting the unsophisticated
trout.</p>

<p>He came on other ancient shepherds, with big flocks of
black sheep, or goats. They always bowed profoundly,
then resumed their statuesque pose. From time to time
he passed cottages with red tiled roofs. Sturdy children,
peach-skinned, with dark, glossy hair, and bold black eyes,
came out to stare at him. A poor, proud, self-reliant
race.</p>

<p>Beside each house was its own private graveyard.
Often the tombs were walled, so that the dead were better
housed than the living.</p>

<p>Sometimes the road dived into groves of cork-trees.
They had all been stripped of their barks, the new growth
showing by its colour and depth the number of years since
each tree had been scaled.</p>

<p>Hugh found the way full of interest, and would have
been very happy indeed, had it not been for the thought
of the money. It haunted him. Why had Doctor Bergius<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[355]</span>
brought it here? Had he given the others the slip,
or were they all here? If they were, then heaven help
him! They would soon be on his trail, and would never
let up. They were relentless. In this lonely seabound
island how could he escape them? In spite of the bright
sunshine and the reassuring tranquillity of his surroundings,
he shuddered.</p>

<p>High up in the folds of the hills he saw grey mountain
villages, each clustered about a tall church, and looking
so still, so dreamlike, that it was hard to believe any one
lived there. Nearly all the women he met were dressed in
black with black-silk scarfs knotted around their heads.
He remembered that in this land the period of mourning
is seven years, so that it is rare for a woman to be out
of black.</p>

<p>He had passed many round rings of stone on the green
sward. He asked a stalwart farmer what they were and
was told that they were threshing floors. They still used
oxen to trample the corn as they had done ever since the
time of the Romans. Then as the sun was setting, he
met a caped and bearded shepherd, leading home his flock,
and carrying a lost lamb in his arms.</p>

<p>It was evening when he reached Ponte Lecchio and
found a lodging for the night. His room was large and
lofty, quite bare except for a large crucifix on the white-washed
wall. As he was dropping off to sleep he thought
of Margot. She must be very busy preparing for her
wedding. He ought to write to her, and give her his
fraternal blessing. But somehow he couldn’t. Of course,
what she was doing was for the best. He hoped she
would be happy and all that sort of thing. He had always
advised her to marry, and now she was doing it;
yet somehow it made him melancholy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[356]</span>“I’ll get over it,” he sighed dolefully; “I’ll forget all
about her.”</p>

<p>In the morning he resumed his tramp. He had luncheon
at a place called Omessa, in an <i>auberge</i>. He ate slices
of the raw ham of the country, Roquefort cheese made on
the neighbouring farms, figs and walnuts, all washed down
with the rich wine of the country. Thus heartened he
continued his way. As he neared the station of Omessa
he heard the train whistle. He loitered to let it pass. He
bought a couple of oranges from a woman squatting on
the platform beside a great round basket full of them, then
stepped back into the grimy waiting room. He was idly
peeling one of the oranges when the train drew up. The
window of the waiting room was plastered with time-table
bills, but in the narrow space between them Hugh
peered out.</p>

<p>Suddenly his heart seemed to lift in a sickening way.
At the door of a first class carriage were three men,—Castelli,
Golaz and Gamba. They were after him. As
he stared through the narrow chink he saw Gamba descend
and buy some oranges. Then a fourth man came from the
back of the compartment. It was Wilbur P. Hoffmann.
The supposed American looked up and down the platform.
His face was worried and anxious. Hugh’s suspicion was
correct. That hard, grim face, dominated by its beak-like
nose, was none other than Doctor Bergius.</p>

<p>“Take a look round the station,” cried the doctor to
Gamba. “He may be here. We cannot afford to take
any chances.”</p>

<p>Hugh had just time to rush from the waiting room
by the back door as Gamba entered. He heard a step on
the wooden floor, and knew the little man was coming
after him. How could he escape? At the end of the station<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[357]</span>
house was a small stone building into which he darted.
He pulled the door shut, holding the handle with all his
strength. Around him were brushes and a ladder. Under
his feet he heard the crunch of coal. He was evidently
in the closet used by the caretaker of the station. As he
held the door, he heard a step outside and Gamba seized
the handle, cursing volubly. Hugh held on grimly. Although
Gamba supposed the door was locked, he made
another effort to open it. He had powerful hands had
the Strangler. Hugh felt the handle gradually turning
in his grip. Another instant and Gamba would conquer.
Then the train whistled, and Gamba hurried off.</p>

<p>Hugh waited a full ten minutes before he emerged from
the closet. The train has gone; he saw it puffing far up
the valley. There was no one on the platform. He was
safe.</p>

<p>For the moment at least. The train was bearing his
enemies away, but to-morrow they would return. When
they discovered he had not arrived at Agaccio they would
double back. They were like a pack of blood hounds
on his trail and the hunt was only beginning. He was
entirely at their mercy. He must use his wits and trust
to Providence.</p>


<h4>2.</h4>

<p>Before he reached Corte the weather had changed;
clouds had collected, and a fine rain was falling. He
found a poor room in a large, unsanitary hotel, but dined
decently on an omelette and some fried trout.</p>

<p>Corte in the drizzling twilight was very depressing. An
old fortress stood on a rocky point against a savage mountain.
Clammy scarfs of mist wreathed the peaks and
trailed down the passes. Hugh wandered about the muddy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[358]</span>
main street, halting on the greasy pavement to peer down
dark and ruinous courts. Seen under that cowl of sky,
through the curtain of soft rain, Corte was indeed a
joyless and discomforting place.</p>

<p>He sought his room, and spent an uneasy night between
damp sheets. He was sorry now he had not made for
Bastia and hid there until a boat sailed. The thought of
the doctor and his band of desperadoes frankly terrified
him. Well, he would go on now, and trust to luck.</p>

<p>Next morning the rain had ceased, although it still
threatened. It would be better, he thought, to lunch by
the wayside; and he bought some cheese, fruit, bread and a
bottle of wine. Thus provisioned he started up the mountain
road that was to take him on the next stage of his
journey.</p>

<p>Ever since he had left Cassamozza he had been climbing
steadily. He had left behind the lemon and orange groves,
and now was steadily mounting to a land of oak forests
and ravines. The flocks of sheep had given place to herds
of goats, and the <i>maquis</i> was growing more and more
aggressive. Down in the dim valley, like a silver tape,
was the Tavignano meandering to the sea. On the other
side of the valley were two precipitously perched
villages. He passed many little roadside shrines, and one
or two old lime kilns. Here and there were bearded goatherds
in long black cloaks, standing as motionless as scarecrows
in a wheatfield. At noon he sat down on the edge of
the <i>maquis</i> and ate his luncheon.</p>

<p>He was just finishing his meal, when he paused and
listened. Surely he heard the faint chugging of a motor....
Yes, yonder it was, a small car cautiously descending
the mountain road. Some instinct made him draw back
into the bush. Well he did so, for it was the four men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[359]</span>
who were hunting him, Castelli driving with the doctor,
Golaz and Gamba behind. Hugh saw their eyes searching
the road on either side. Now they were looking at the
very spot where he lay. But the brush was thick, and
they passed slowly on. A narrow escape!</p>

<p>They must have started early that morning from
Agaccio. He knew they would have little difficulty in tracing
him on that island where strangers were rare. It was
just a question of time, of getting his location narrowed
down. They would learn that he had stopped at Corte and
had taken the road to Agaccio. Then they would turn back
to search for him, inquiring at every house and village
on the way. Beyond him was the little hillside town of
Venaco. They would inquire if he had passed through.
Well, he would not pass through; he would take to the
<i>maquis</i> and go round.</p>

<p>All afternoon he kept to the <i>maquis</i>, avoiding villages,
hamlets and even houses. He scrambled over rocks, stumbled
through brush. He flattered himself that not even a
peasant had seen him. He kept close to the road, his ear
ever alert for the far off sound of a motor.</p>

<p>He was making slow progress, but he could see no other
way. By now they must have traced him to Corte, and
learned that he was but a few miles away. Doubtless they
had asked the peasants to look out for him, even offered a
reward. Perhaps at that very moment a score of stalwart
Corsicans were scouring the bush for him. He had but
one slim chance of escape, that of lying low, working his
way to Agaccio and catching the boat for Marseilles.</p>

<p>He decided to sleep that night in the <i>maquis</i>. Under the
shadow of an overhanging rock he found a place that was
quite dry and screened by the foliage of an oak tree. He
made a tiny fire, ate what remained of his food, and smoked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[360]</span>
a good deal. If only he had had a blanket he would have
been fairly comfortable.</p>

<p>He arose with the dawn, stiff and sore. He took to the
road, thinking he would meet no one at that early hour.
He was ravenously hungry and felt reckless. When he
came to the solitary house of a shepherd, he ventured to approach
it and ask for food.</p>

<p>It was a two storied house with plastered walls, and a
red tiled roof. An outer stairway led to the upper floor
where the family lived; the ground floor was used as a
stable.</p>

<p>As he knocked at the rough door he told himself he must
seem rather a sorry sight. A night in the <i>maquis</i> had not
improved his appearance. If he had only been wearing the
corduroys of the country ... but he was in a brown
Norfolk jacket, grey flannel trousers and a panama. He
was not surprised when the bearded and spectacled old
man who opened the door stared at him with astonishment.</p>

<p>“Can I have something to eat?” he asked.</p>

<p>Corsican hospitality is proverbial.</p>

<p>“<i>Entrez donc, monsieur</i>,” said the old man.</p>

<p>Hugh entered. The house consisted of but one big room
meagerly furnished. Hams hung from the rafters, and at a
small stove a woman, surrounded by a brood of half-clad
children, was preparing coffee. The old man offered him a
chair.</p>

<p>“The place is yours, monsieur. Make yourself at home.”</p>

<p>He ate some bread and drank his coffee, then rose to go.
The old man detained him. In half intelligible French he
began to relate the family history: they were miserably
poor; his son, the father of the small brood, only worked
at intervals. They had a garden, some goats, pigs,
chickens, a few cultivated acres. Praise God there was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[361]</span>
always something to feed the children. Would monsieur
like to taste their home-cured ham? Ah! now he must
insist.</p>

<p>There was a heavy step on the outer stair and the old
man went quickly to the door. Hugh heard hurried whispers
then the step descended rapidly. The old man returned,
and continued to cut the ham. He offered it raw
after the fashion of the country. Hugh would have preferred
it cooked, but under the circumstances he thought
it best to bolt it down as it was. Then he rose again and
said he must be on his way.</p>

<p>Again the old man tried to detain him. “Why not
stay a little and rest yourself? There is a nice warm bed,
and we have goat’s meat for dinner. You must see how
good it is.”</p>

<p>The old man almost hung onto his arm. His eagerness
seemed very suspicious, so Hugh gently detached himself
and bade good-bye to the family. As he went up the road,
he saw them all watching him from the doorway.</p>

<p>No sooner was the house out of sight than he took to
the <i>maquis</i>. His fears were justified, for about an hour
later two cars passed very slowly. The first, the small
green one he had already seen, contained Castelli, Golaz
and Gamba; the other, a big powerful grey, driven by a
chauffeur, held Doctor Bergius. They had heard of
him, no doubt, at the house of the shepherd, and were
patrolling the road. But, hidden as he was in that dense
jungle of <i>maquis</i>, they had little chance of finding him.
He imagined that they must have telegraphed to Bastia
for the big grey car.</p>

<p>About two o’clock he saw the two cars going back in
the direction of Venaco, and once more ventured to take
to the road. As he passed a dismal farm a man and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[362]</span>
woman paused in their work to regard him. He wanted
to ask them for food, but their manner was so strange that
he decided it was wiser to go on. When he was a little way
from the house, he saw the man leap on a mule and ride
off in the opposite direction. Evidently the whole countryside
had been warned, and every one was on the look-out
for him. It would be only a matter of time before they
cornered him. Once again he took to the <i>maquis</i>.</p>

<p>Rain had begun to fall. The underbrush was drenched
and he was cold and wet. Still he pushed doggedly on.
His despair gave him strength and he covered quite a
distance. He cut off a big bend in the road by going
straight through the bush. As he was in the midst of
the <i>maquis</i> he heard again the sound of a motor. Climbing
a rock he peered cautiously over the country. Close
to the road a number of peasants were moving back and
forth. They were beating the bush for him.</p>

<p>Still more cautiously he moved forward. Half an hour
later he came out on the road once more. Not far away
he heard the beaters crashing through the brush. Soon
they must find him. He peered around carefully ...
then his heart leaped.</p>

<p>Standing by the side of the road was the little green
car. It was empty. Castelli and the others had gotten
out and were searching for him. He looked up and down
the road. There was no sign of them.</p>

<p>Then a desperate idea came to him.... Yes, he
would do it.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[363]</span>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER THREE<br />


IN THE MOUNTAINS</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ONCE more he looked up and down the road. Still
no sign of any one. Now was the moment.</p>

<p>He sprang to the little green car and spun
the handle. Would it start or not? The motor breathed
gently. Exultation flamed in him. A good car and a
good road ... the devil himself could not stop him
now. He leapt to the seat, jerking off the brake and
giving her gas at the same moment. Then he heard a
shout from behind, and turned his head sharply. About
a hundred yards behind him Gamba had come out of the
<i>maquis</i>.</p>

<p>There was no time to lose. The little man was running
like a deer. How about the gears? Hugh looked down
at the gate in which they worked, a four-speed gear box.
They must go the usual way,—front, back, cross and
front, back. Quick, Gamba was getting closer! He
jammed in the first speed, and the car moved slowly forward.
Second speed! He was going faster now, but
Gamba was still gaining. Third speed! He heard close
behind him the hard, panting breath of his pursuer.
Gamba was running like the wind. Quickly he shot into
high; and at the same instant he heard a heavy thump
on the back of the car. Gamba had jumped and was
hanging on behind.</p>

<p>The car was going at a fair speed now. If he only could
get rid of that grinning little devil behind all would be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[364]</span>
well. Gamba was hoisting himself up. Soon he would be
in the car, and then.... Hugh looked back once more.
The man was waist-high above the hood. In another moment
it would be too late. Ha! there on the floor by his
feet was a spare can of petrol. That might do. He
reached for it and with all his strength flung it over his
shoulder. It must have caught Gamba square on the face,
for he heard a crash and a howl. When he looked again
Gamba was gone. He had a brief glimpse of him sprawling
on the road. Then on and on at increasing speed.</p>

<p>Suddenly from the <i>maquis</i> he heard a shout like the
hoarse bellow of a bull. Before him, on a snag of rock,
was the burly figure of Golaz. The man shook huge
fists at him in impotent rage. The rock was about twenty
yards away from the road and Hugh knew he could pass
it before Golaz had time to descend. He put on a burst
of speed. The car leapt forward.</p>

<p>What was Golaz after? He had bent down and was
wrenching furiously at the rock. He detached a great
fragment of it and stood with it poised above his head.
What a ferocious figure he made against that savage background,
his dark face distorted with rage!</p>

<p>Instinctively Hugh slowed up. He knew what was coming.
A car is a hard object to miss, and that great rock
crashing down on any part of it, would hopelessly wreck
him. There was no way of avoiding it; the road was
narrow with thick brush on either hand. Nothing but to
dash forward and take his chance.</p>

<p>He opened the throttle to the full, and the little car
answered like a living thing. It seemed to pause for an
astonished moment, then bounded forward so swiftly that
it almost seemed to leave the ground. At the same instant
the great stone came crashing down.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[365]</span>Would it hit him? He heard a snarl of rage from
Golaz and a dull thump on the road behind him. Yes,
that admirable response of his engine, that sudden spurt
of speed had deceived the man. The great stone had
missed by a hand’s breadth.</p>

<p>“Oh, you gallant little beast!” breathed Hugh to the
car. “You’re a thoroughbred. You’ll save me yet.”</p>

<p>Behind him Golaz continued to roar and wave his arms.
Hugh had a flash of intuition that his danger was not
yet over. He was right. From the <i>maquis</i> about a hundred
yards ahead, darted the figure of another man ...
Castelli. He stood in the centre of the road with his
automatic pistol, and waited. Hugh was reckless. He
must pass that man. A wave of hate surged through him;
Castelli was trying to kill him; well, then, he would try to
kill Castelli. He would run him down.</p>

<p>The car was going at full speed, rocking and bounding
in its leaps. Castelli drew a little to one side and with a
quick twist of the wheel Hugh swerved and bore down on
him. The man saw his intention and sprang away. That
leap saved Hugh; a bullet struck and starred his windshield;
another whistled past his head; a third punched a
harmless hole in one of his rear mud-guards. Then he
passed out of range. He was free ... free.</p>

<p>Once more exultation flamed in him. The road, ever
climbing higher, followed the folds of the mountains.
Sometimes, as he looked ahead, it would seem to come
to an end and the careening car be about to leap into
the vast void of the valley. But as he drew near, it
hooked sharply round, and with a wrench of the wheel
he was safe on a new stretch. Below him, far, far below,
he could see the white bed of the Tavignano, the river like
a blue ribband tangled amid the boulders. He seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[366]</span>
to be in the clouds, and rising, rising to the top of the
world. He stopped the car for a moment to consult his
map.</p>

<p>Good! It was only three o’clock, and not more than
some eighty kilometres to Agaccio. If nothing happened
he could make it by nightfall. True, they might telegraph
to the police, and have him stopped at some wayside
village. No, that was not likely. They did not want
to have any dealings with the police. Once at Agaccio he
was safe.</p>

<p>He was about to start again, when he heard a sound
that checked him. With a hand on the wheel he listened
intently. From far down the valley it came, the faint
tick-tock of a straining motor. He ran his eye along
the sinuous curve of road that was like a white tape-line
tacked to the mountain. Yes, there it was, about two
miles away, the long grey auto racing in pursuit.</p>

<p>“If they want to catch me, they’ll have to do some
giddy going,” he muttered, as once more he slammed on
his speeds.</p>

<p>The little car, panting with eagerness, ate up the road.
If only it had been a straight road he could have launched
forward, but the hair-pin bends baffled him. As he swung
around them, a swerve of a few inches would have shot him
a thousand feet into the valley below. Ahead of him the
mountains rose like a solid wall, gaunt and stupendous.
They seemed to crowd around him, to close him in, to block
his way. Clouds cloaked their higher summits and the
drizzling rain had grown chill and dispiriting. The increasing
stickiness of the way made careful driving more
and more necessary. Dizzily on his right rose the mountain;
on his left sheerly dropped the valley. A skid would
be fatal.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[367]</span>Nervously he slackened speed, but even as he did so his
heart seemed to contract. On the bend of the hill below
he saw the grey car. It swung madly round a corner and
strained on with relentless energy. That chauffeur must
be a demon. The four men were urging him to greater
speed, bending forward with fierce excited gestures. They
were not more than half a mile behind and every second the
distance was lessening. Once more Hugh gave the car gas
and she leaped forward.</p>

<p>They should not capture him. That would mean torture,
death. He knew them. They were exasperated now
beyond all reason. They would show him no mercy. And
they were gaining on him, gaining relentlessly, inch by
inch.</p>

<p>It was getting gloomier, he noticed,—and more chilly.
Yet in spite of the increasing cold, great drops of sweat
beaded his brow. With hands tensely clutching the driving
wheel he glared at the glistening road ahead. His
motor was going with a steady roar; and the car was
bucking and plunging in a maddened frenzy of speed. He
was near the top of the long valley, and soon would be
dashing into the dark defiles of the mountains. But
before he could reach them he would have to pass over
a long bit of straight road. It was on this, he feared, the
final tussle would come.</p>

<p>He had not gone more than a third of a mile when he
heard the grey car come around the corner behind him.
They were now on the same stretch, running for every last
ounce of power in their motors. The grey car roared
down on him like the wind. It must be doing eighty miles
an hour to his forty. With his foot jammed hard on
the gas-pedal, he clutched the bucking wheel. The car
bounded and rocked beneath him. It was all he could do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[368]</span>
to keep it on the road. The hillside was a blur, the wind
screamed in his ears.</p>

<p>With every spin of its great engine the grey car was
gaining. He dared not look around, but he felt sure that
the four men were reaching forward, revolvers in hands,
tense, grim, implacable. The giant panting of their
motor drowned the roar of his own. He could do no
more, ... he was at his full burst of speed.</p>

<p>He watched the road rise sharply before him. It was
on that long slope he would be caught. He knew it. As
he struck the rise, his speed dropped. Not so that of the
grey car, it seemed to come on faster than ever. It
roared like an angry monster; its panting deafened
him....</p>

<p>What was that? A bullet. They were near enough to
shoot; they had him! He crouched low as another bullet
sung past his ears. In a moment more he would jam in
his brakes, stop the car brutally, leap into the <i>maquis</i>. He
had a revolver; he would sell his life for a grim price.
At least two of these devils should pay!</p>

<p>Then he heard another report, and his heart gave a leap
of joy. Could it be the bursting of a tire? Yes, he was
right. There were shouts, curses, furious exclamations,
then silence. On he hurtled, hardly believing in his luck.
He could no longer hear them, and at the head of the
valley, he slowed up and looked round. The grey car had
come to a standstill. The men had gotten out and were
busy fitting on a new tire. That would take them ten
minutes at least. He had already gained nearly a mile.
In ten minutes he could do another five. Let him only have
six miles between them, and, with luck, he would beat them
yet. He put on speed again.</p>

<p>How marvellously the road was mounting! Great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[369]</span>
craggy peaks soared up on every side. Dark ravines
yawned beneath him. Ahead was a cloud-mass, heavy
as a sponge. The rainy drizzle had thickened to a
downpour. The car now splashed through pools of water,
now slithered over stretches of mud. Then the forests
began to close in on both sides of the road and give him
a sense of security. The country had completely changed.
The road descended into dripping oakgroves, and spanned
dark gulleys, down which brawled angry torrents.</p>

<p>Then it began to climb again, and the oaks gave
way to pines. He had been travelling for nearly an hour,
and had heard no sound of his pursuers. What had happened
to them? Perhaps something worse than a damaged
tire. He must be far ahead of them by now. He was
rapidly mounting to the Col of Vizzavona. According to
his map, when he had crossed the divide, he would drop
down into Agaccio. Only let him surmount the Col and
he could coast downhill for the rest of the way. He
should make Agaccio by dark. For the third time that
day he glowed with exultation.</p>

<p>It was getting very cold. The pines were chill and
gloomy. The rain seemed to sting.... What was that
just ahead, that patch of white? Surely it could not be
snow? Yes. It was a short stretch, quite shallow. The
car bounded through it easily. But look, another, broader,
deeper! The car slid a little this time, and his heart
sank. Then he saw the road was clear, and his hopes
rose again. He mounted a ridge. He must be in the very
heart of the mountains now. The mist rolled and dipped,
cloaking the stark peaks that ringed him round. Surely
he could not go much higher.</p>

<p>Again the road dropped swiftly. At the bottom of the
dip, his car plunged into a great drift of snow, a foot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[370]</span>
deep and half melted. For a few yards it struggled on,
them slackened speed and came almost to a standstill. Desperately
he strove to force his way through; his wheels
were whirring and slipping in the rain-rotted snow. He
could not budge. He realized that it was useless.</p>

<p>Jumping out he reconnoitred the road ahead. It was
filled with drifts, snow without a break. He never could
get through. Stalled! Hopelessly stuck! Going back
he tried once again. The car struggled gallantly, but
to no use. He looked at it ruefully.</p>

<p>“Bless you, you gallant little beast,” he said. “You’ve
served me more than nobly. Now it’s got to be good-bye.”</p>

<p>Then he left the road and plunged into the forest.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER FOUR<br />


IN THE FOREST</h3>
</div>

<h4>1.</h4>

<p class="drop-cap">HE intended to remain in the cover of the forest,
even, if need be, to spend the night there. In
any case he would keep well away from the road
and work through the wild country to Agaccio. Fortunately
the forest was an open one. On the heights were
pines, in the hollows oaks. Under the trees the rocks
were covered with moss or a short growth of fern.
There was nothing to impede him save the frequent gorges
and brawling streams, and he made good progress. He
was wet through; but in his excitement he felt neither
cold nor fatigue, not even hunger.</p>

<p>Then, as night drew near, he began to be conscious of
all three. The prospect of passing the hours of darkness
in the forest daunted him. He might become crippled
with rheumatism, perhaps contract pneumonia. He was
afraid.</p>

<p>So presently stumbling on a narrow trail, he followed
it eagerly, even breaking into a run. It was well defined
and must lead to some habitation.</p>

<p>It had grown dark and he could hardly see the path.
Several times he lost it and stumbled into wet fern. He
went on more cautiously, drenched, shivering, discouraged.
Would the trail never end? It went up and up, climbing
deeper into the savage fastnesses. He was so tired,
so miserably tired; he longed to lie down and rest.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[372]</span>
But that would be fatal. He must struggle on. His
heart failed him, his weakness increased. Perhaps the
little trail led nowhere. Despair seized him. Just as he
was about to succumb, he saw a light. It was streaming
through the shuttered window of a house, a house so near
he almost blundered into it. He found the door and
knocked. A step; then a voice asked:</p>

<p>“Who is there?”</p>

<p>“A traveller. I’ve lost my way. Please let me in.”</p>

<p>A heavy bolt was drawn, and the door opened cautiously.
A tall old man holding a lamp over his head,
stood in the doorway. His face was in the shadow, but
Hugh could see that it was round and jovial. The man
looked at him for a long moment, then said:</p>

<p>“Ah! my poor monsieur, you are indeed in a plight.
Excuse me that I did not open sooner. But there are
bandits about, and one has to be careful.”</p>

<p>He led Hugh into a bare room in which there was a
long table and some rough benches. It was like the
public room of some country <i>auberge</i>, hard, primitive,
nakedly clean, but its cheerlessness was vanquished by a
huge fire that blazed in the great open fireplace. The old
man set the lamp on the table.</p>

<p>“Welcome, monsieur. My name is Pascal Martini. I
keep a place of public entertainment; you have fallen
well.”</p>

<p>“And I am a tourist,” said Hugh. “I was going to
Agaccio in a car, but got stuck in the snow near the summit,
and followed a trail that led me here.”</p>

<p>“It is good,” said Martini. “If you had followed the
road you would have gotten waist deep in snow. It has
lasted now for three days, the storm. And to think that
down near the coast they have oranges and peach trees in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[373]</span>
blossom. It is wonderful, our Corsica. We have three
climates in so small a space. I regret that we are giving
you at this moment a taste of its most unpleasant one.
You are wet through. If you will condescend to wear
some of my poor garments I will give you a complete
change.”</p>

<p>Hugh expressed his gratitude, and, standing in the
glow of the blazing logs, stripped and rubbed himself with
a rough towel. He felt the glow return to his frozen limbs.
He put on the woollen shirt, stockings, and the corduroy
breeches Martini handed to him.</p>

<p>“The costume of a hunter,” said the inn-keeper. “It
is chiefly hunters and fishermen who come here. Sometimes
wood-cutters. Occasionally bandits.”</p>

<p>“Where am I?” asked Hugh.</p>

<p>“About five miles up in the mountains behind Vizzavona.
Later in the year hunting parties come and my place is
always full. Now there is no one. I am indeed glad to
see you. But I waste time. I must prepare you some
supper. You must be ravenous.”</p>

<p>“I am rather.”</p>

<p>“Ah, my poor monsieur! And I have no meat in the
house. What a misfortune. All I can offer you is fish,
fresh mountain trout. Come, you shall see. I will catch
them fresh from the water.”</p>

<p>He lit a pine torch at the fire, and taking a scoop-net
in his hand, led the way to the back of the house where
Hugh heard the roar of the stream.</p>

<p>“In the dark you cannot see,” said Martini; “but it is
really very picturesque here. The back of my house is
level with the face of rock that falls to the stream. It
forms a very deep pool that I call my fish-pond. I stock
it against the time when I have many guests. At the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[374]</span>
upper end is a small waterfall, and at the lower I have a
grill so that the fish cannot escape. You can hear the roar
of my waterfall. I love it. It is something alive in the
deadness and silence of the forest. In the night I awake
and hear its friendly roar. I have been a sailor, monsieur,
and it reminds me of the sea. In the morning I strip and
stand under it. I brace myself and let it crash down on
me; it beats and stings. In the coldest weather it is only
pleasantly bitter, a hearty tonic.... Now, if monsieur
will wait here, I will descend the rock and get some fish.”</p>

<p>As Hugh looked down, he thought how strange and wild
was the scene. The old man bent over the water and the
flare of his torch revealed the mysterious depths of the
pool, and the white curtain of the waterfall. Overhead
was the harsh foliage of the pines. The inn-keeper
scooped round in the coppery eddy of the water,
and presently climbed back up the face of the rock. In
his net two silvery trout were leaping and gasping.</p>

<p>“There! I have already supped; but I expect you can
manage both.”</p>


<h4>2.</h4>

<p>Hugh always remembered that evening before the glorious
fire. He smoked old Pascal’s tobacco, and listened to
his yarns. The inn-keeper had voyaged far, and could talk
of many lands, but always he brought the conversation
back to Corsica.</p>

<p>“It is the vendetta that makes the bandits,” said Pascal.
“They are not bad men as a rule. But they have made
their kill, and from then on are forced to live beyond the
clutches of the law. Very often it all arises from a political
brawl; for we Corsicans are fiery politicians. That
was the case with Angelo Rocco, who lives in a cave five<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[375]</span>
kilometres from here. They say he had quite a future
before him in public life. But one night in a café the
heady Corsican wine was flowing, words ran high, pistols
were drawn, an opponent of Rocco was shot; and Rocco
had to take to the mountains. He belongs to a very old
and distinguished family, too. Every one sympathizes
with him; even the gendarmes let him alone. He often
comes here. He can have all I’ve got.... But, of
course, they are not all like that.”</p>

<p>Hugh saw the inn-keeper through an increasing veil of
drowsiness. As he leaned forward to prime his pipe in
the glow of the great fire Pascal was a striking figure, a
tall, strong, hearty old man with thick grey hair and a
pleasant smile on his ruddy face. Then suddenly a shadow
seemed to fall on it; it grew grim, even sinister. The
tone of his voice changed.</p>

<p>“No, they are not all like that. Monsieur, I, too, am
involved in a blood feud. It is for that I sailed the seas
for half a lifetime; for that I now shutter my windows at
night. Yet it was long ago, that last vengeance. It was
a younger brother of mine who fell. He was only a child,
playing on the doorstep before my mother’s eyes. A
dark man came out of the mountains and shot him even
as he rushed to her arms. ‘Bad weeds are best uprooted
young,’ the murderer said cynically, and went away....”</p>

<p>Pascal rose suddenly. His face was convulsed with passion,
his hands knotted. He seemed transformed into a
savage beast.</p>

<p>“I’ll get him yet,” he cried. “He’s an old, old man now,
but I’ll kill him like a dog. Yes, I’ll get him yet....”</p>

<p>Then the inn-keeper gave an uneasy look at his shuttered
windows and added: “That is, if he doesn’t get me....
But here I am, I am yarning away about my own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[376]</span>
affairs, and monsieur is so weary, he drops asleep. Pardon me.
Come, I will show you to your room.”</p>

<p>He conducted Hugh up a steep stairway that gave on
a narrow corridor.</p>

<p>“Here are three rooms. I will give you the middle one,
which is the biggest. It looks out over the valley. To-morrow
you will see the red fire of the sunrise on the
snowy peaks.”</p>

<p>When he had gone, Hugh opened his window. The
night air was icily pure; it smelled of snow and
pines. He breathed it quietly for a time. Against the
dark blue of the higher heavens rose the black blue of
mountain pinnacles. In savage majesty they soared
among the stars. He heard the continuous roar of the
little waterfall.</p>

<p>Then a melancholy born of the absolute solitude came
over him. He longed for the lights of the city, the comfort
and security of the streets of Paris. Why Paris?
Perhaps because Margot was there. He thought of her
with a sudden poignant sense of desire. He was tired of
adventures and unrest. He wanted to settle down ...
a placid life ... always. Margot would shield him from
the worries of every day, be like a buffer, make him a
home. She was that sort. He didn’t want a wife he had
to fuss over; he wanted one who would fuss over him....
But it was too late to think of Margot. She was marrying
another man. He had lost her.... In a profound mood
of gloom and regret, he wearily undressed and went to bed.</p>

<p>He awoke with a curious sense of fear, a strange stiffening
of the scalp. Surely he heard the sound of voices. He
sat up with beating heart and listened. Yes, voices and
the sound of feet crushing through the crisp snow....
With a leap he was at the window.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER FIVE<br />


HUNTED DOWN</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">HIS worst fears were realized.</p>

<p>In the eerie half-light he saw four black shadows
draw near to the house and a knock at the door
followed. He heard Pascal grumbling as he got out of
bed. Then the inn-keeper’s voice:</p>

<p>“Who is it?”</p>

<p>The answer came in the harsh metallic voice he knew so
well.</p>

<p>“Travellers from Vizzavona. Open quickly. We are
cold.”</p>

<p>Pascal was unbolting the door.</p>

<p>“Pardon, gentlemen. I did not expect guests at so
late an hour. Please to enter.”</p>

<p>He heard them stumbling into the big room with the
fire, then again that grating voice.</p>

<p>“Ah! you have another guest?”</p>

<p>“Yes, a young man who arrived this evening.”</p>

<p>“These are his clothes, no doubt, drying by the fire?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he was very wet.”</p>

<p>“Then he is sleeping, perhaps. We must not make a
noise.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he was very tired. He went to bed early, directly
after supper. That makes me think.... Do the
messieurs want anything to eat?”</p>

<p>“No, we have supped. We are tired, however. We
would sleep. What rooms have you?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[378]</span>“There are three upstairs, but the young gentleman has
the middle one. I can give you gentlemen the others.”</p>

<p>“Good. You will take one, Castelli; I the other. The
two men can sleep here by the fire. Now, patron, if
you have some good brandy, a drop might not be amiss.”</p>

<p>Hugh had heard enough. He crept back hastily, locking
his door. He must escape from this house, and
quickly. He began to dress in the clothes Pascal had
given him. With a groan he remembered that he had
left his revolver in the pocket of his coat. Too bad,
that!</p>

<p>Fully dressed, he went to the door and listened again.
Doctor Bergius and Castelli were being shown upstairs to
their rooms, one on each side of his own. He heard them
enter, then Pascal descend the stairs again. All was quiet.</p>

<p>He opened the window very softly and peered out. It
was a drop to the ground of about twenty-five feet. He
dared not risk the fall. Then his heart leaped. At the
side of the window was a rain pipe running from the roof
to the ground. It would be easy to slide down that. He
did not know their plans, but they would wait, no doubt,
until Pascal had gone to bed before attempting anything.</p>

<p>A long silence.</p>

<p>Now there were stealthy steps in the corridor and whispering.
With his ear to the door he listened. His hearing
was unnaturally acute, and he distinctly heard
Castelli:</p>

<p>“Gamba, where is Golaz?”</p>

<p>“Waiting by the door, Master.”</p>

<p>“Right. Our man is trapped. He can’t escape this
time. You and Golaz watch to see he doesn’t descend by
the window. If the inn-keeper interferes, settle him. And
mind, we must take the Englishman alive. No reckless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[379]</span>
shooting. After we’ve got what we want out of him,
you can do as you please. Now go.”</p>

<p>Again a long silence.</p>

<p>Hugh thought, “They suppose I am asleep. Soon they
will try my door.”</p>

<p>He waited. Ten minutes, a quarter of an hour passed.
Everything was still. One might have thought that all
the house slept.... Some one was gently trying the
handle of his door, turning it softly first one way and
then the other. He heard a harsh whisper: “Locked.”</p>

<p>Again he heard the grating voice of the doctor. “I
thought so. Well, there’s nothing for it but violence.
Put your pistol to the lock and burst it.”</p>

<p><i>Crash!</i> In the silence of the house the explosion seemed
terrific. There was a splintering of wood and the lock
was torn from its fixings. But the bolt still held, and
though Castelli shook and hammered on the door it would
not open. Again he heard the voice of Doctor Bergius.</p>

<p>“Brace yourself against the wall of the corridor. Come,
we’ll both put our strength into it.”</p>

<p>Hugh heard the door strain, crack. It was stout and
still held. But it could not last long. In another minute
it would give way. He ran to the window and leaned out.
Then he drew in sharply, for from the darkness two bullets
shattered the pane. Golaz and Gamba were on watch
down there. No escape that way.</p>

<p>He wheeled around, desperate. The door under the
combined weight of Castelli and the doctor was beginning
to bulge, to crack. In another minute they would be in
the room. He was trapped, unarmed, helpless. He was
lost.</p>

<p>Then suddenly the pressure on his door ceased. They
had paused to listen to what was going on below. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[380]</span>
inn-keeper had jumped out of bed and run into the
kitchen.</p>

<p>Hugh heard him cry: “What’s wrong! <i>Nom de Dieu!</i>
What’s the matter? Ho! there, you two fellows!...
Why, they’re gone. Ah! the door’s open....”</p>

<p>Daring another shot Hugh leaned from the window.
Golaz had taken up a position behind the door and as the
inn-keeper came out, threw his arms around him. In that
bear hug of a grip, Pascal was as helpless as a child.
He gave one great, hoarse cry, then Gamba had him by
the throat.</p>

<p>The three were locked in a silent, deadly struggle.
All at once Hugh heard again the ominous crack of the
breaking door. Now was his time, now or never. He
would slip down the pipe and then ... leave the rest to
luck. As he climbed out on the sill of the window he heard
a cry of alarm. Golaz and Gamba had seen him. They
still gripped the inn-keeper. When he slipped to the foot
of the pipe he, too, would be seized and held. No, that
way was madness. What to do then?</p>

<p>There was another way ... up! The eaves of the
house were only a few feet above his window. That was it,
the roof.</p>

<p>So instead of slipping down the iron pipe, he wriggled
upward. He clutched the gutter that collected the rain.
It held and with a fierce jerk he pulled himself level. A
second later he was sprawling on the slope of the roof.</p>

<p>From below came a howl of baffled rage. Golaz and
Gamba were cursing both him and themselves. At the
same instant Castelli and the doctor burst into the room.
Soon came the voice of Doctor Bergius from the window.</p>

<p>“Where is he? Have you seen him?”</p>

<p>“Yes, the roof. He’s on the roof.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[381]</span>“Oh, you fools, you cursed fools! Why did you let him
get away again? What have you got there?”</p>

<p>“The inn-keeper. He tried to interfere.”</p>

<p>“Seems to me he’s lying suspiciously still. Hold on, I’m
coming down.”</p>

<p>There was a pause; then again the voice of the doctor.
“Gamba, you little devil, the man’s dead!”</p>

<p>“Yes, Master,” said Gamba humbly, “I’m afraid I
squeezed a little too hard.”</p>

<p>“Bah! well, too late now. Take the body and throw it
into the stream at the back. People will think he was
drowned. Where’s the Englishman?”</p>

<p>“One can’t see him. The angle of the house hides him.
But he’s up there all right.”</p>

<p>“Very well. You two men dispose of that body; Castelli,
you run back a bit and see if you can see him.”</p>

<p>Hugh realized that, where he lay flat on the snow-covered
roof, he was an easy mark. A belated moon
gleaming through the cloud-fleece, would direct their aim.
On the other side of the house was darkness and the protection
of the stream. He must gain that. Keeping his
feet in the gutter he worked along the roof till he came
to the end of it, then gripping the slate edge, desperately
he pulled himself up until he was astride of the ridge.</p>

<p>A shot whistled past him. That would never do. Castelli
could pick him off as he crouched low on the ridge.
He allowed his body to slip a little way down the side
next to the stream. Thus hidden from them, half embedded
in the snow, he clutched desperately at the angle
of the ridge and waited. What would they do next?</p>

<p>Everything was very quiet, a quiet full of menace. Beyond
a doubt they were carrying out some fresh scheme.
The suspense was too great to be borne; he must know at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[382]</span>
all costs what they were doing. With a great effort he
drew himself up and peered over.</p>

<p>He saw a sight that filled him with terror and despair
... the head and shoulders of Gamba, appearing over
the edge of the roof. Stealthy and catlike the little man
was climbing with no apparent effort. Now he was sliding
like a monkey along the gutter, now he was drawing
himself up to the peak, now he was astride the ridge.
Hugh stared into his black vindictive eyes, saw his lips
parted in that grin of incredible evil, the revolver held
ready in his hand.</p>

<p>“Don’t shoot, Gamba,” he heard the doctor say from
below. “Get him alive. Make him come down.”</p>

<p>Gamba bent over and seized Hugh by the arm; behind
the pointed pistol, his eyes glittered malignantly.</p>

<p>“Come,” he hissed.</p>

<p>With a sudden wrench Hugh freed himself from the
hand that gripped him, and as he did so, he felt himself
sliding. He clutched desperately at the angle of the
roof, but in vain. The snow on which he lay was slipping,
slipping. Gamba clawed at him frantically. Too late!
the whole snow mass crashed down like a miniature avalanche.
Helpless, turning over in the descent, Hugh went
with it, down, down over the edge of the roof into the
black depths below....</p>

<p>He felt himself rushing through space. His one agonizing
thought was: “When I stop falling what will I strike?
Is this the end?” Then....</p>

<p>He plunged into deep water. Instinctively he broke
the force of his descent with his arms and legs; but even
then he struck the rocky bottom forcibly. He rose
quickly to the surface.</p>

<p>He realized that he was in the fish pool, swirling round<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[383]</span>
and round. He put out his hand and clutched at an object.
Ugh! It was the dead body of the inn-keeper.
Horror and fear maddened him. With half a dozen swift
strokes, he had gained the opposite bank. He clutched
hold of some bushes and pulled himself out.</p>

<p>The men had rushed around to the back of the house,
and were firing into the black pool. It was so dark that
they did not see him as he staggered up the rocky bank.
He heard Doctor Bergius shouting in violent anger:</p>

<p>“Gamba, I’ll flay you for this. By God, I’ll kill you.
He’s escaped us again.”</p>

<p>Yes, he was safe—at least for awhile. He stumbled
through the darkness of the forest, half crazed, walking
like a blind man, fear and despair urging him on.</p>

<p>It seemed to him he must have walked for hours, over
rocks, through bush, knee deep in streams, always climbing.
His hands and feet were torn and bleeding. At
length he could go no further....</p>

<p>Some one was shaking him, telling him to get up. Reluctantly
he roused. Above him were a pair of grim,
scornful eyes and a face stern as Fate.</p>

<p>Over the hills the dawn was breaking.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER SIX<br />


THE OUTLAW</h3>
</div>

<h4>1.</h4>

<p class="drop-cap">“WHO are you?”</p>

<p>The voice that addressed Hugh was rich and
imperious.</p>

<p>Hugh looked at the strange face with startled eyes.
“A hunted man,” he answered.</p>

<p>The other laughed. “I, too, am a hunted man. Come,
you are faint with cold and fatigue. I will give you
shelter.”</p>

<p>Hugh clutched his arm. “Don’t let them get me,” he
said with a shudder.</p>

<p>The other laughed scornfully. “Don’t be afraid. With
me you will be safe. Come.”</p>

<p>He lifted Hugh to his feet, and, half supporting him,
led the way up the rocky path.</p>

<p>“You see the door of my home?”</p>

<p>“No, I see nothing.”</p>

<p>“Yonder black hole in the mountain side. That is my
front entrance. Incidentally there is a back one for
my private use, and only known to myself. But maybe
you have heard of me. I am Angelo Rocco.”</p>

<p>Hugh started.</p>

<p>“The ... ah! Celebrity?”</p>

<p>The man laughed again.</p>

<p>“Do not be afraid. You are no enemy of mine, and he
who is not my enemy is my friend. Come, you shall bear
witness to a bandit’s hospitality.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[385]</span>They reached the mouth of the cave.</p>

<p>“See,” said Rocco, “from here I can overlook the whole
mountain side. If twenty men came to take me, I could
shoot them all down before they reached the door. If
fifty came I could shoot half, and the other half would
look for me in vain. But then no one troubles me. It is
understood if I keep out of the way they will leave me
alone.”</p>

<p>They crossed the threshold of the cave. For some distance
it was well lighted by the circular entrance.
Blankets were hung over the walls; furs were strewn on
the floor. A hammock swung from staples fixed in the
rock. On either side were two long <i>banquettes</i> of oak, and
near one of them a black cupboard, on the door of which
hung a large ivory crucifix. Rocco threw open one of the
<i>banquettes</i>.</p>

<p>“Look! there are some dry clothes. Change into them.
Wrap some of these blankets about you, and lie down. I
will make a fire and give you some hot soup.”</p>

<p>Hugh did as he was told. He had almost dropped off
to sleep when Rocco brought him a big bowl of soup. It
was rich and meaty. After he had drunk it, he could no
longer fight against his drowsiness and closing his eyes,
slept as he had never done before.</p>


<h4>2.</h4>

<p>He awakened gradually, and with a growing sense of
tranquillity. The cave was brightening in the light of another
dawn. Outlined against the sky and framed in the
circle of the doorway he saw the superb figure of Angelo
Rocco. The bandit turned and greeted him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[386]</span>“A moment ago,” he said, “I saw a shadow moving at
the edge of the pine wood. Ha! there it is again.”</p>

<p>He snatched up a rifle and fired.</p>

<p>“There! that will frighten him, whoever he is. If he
means no harm, let him come out into the open. Now I
will give you some breakfast. My friends keep me supplied
with food from the city. I shoot game, but once in
a while it is good to eat civilized food.”</p>

<p>They had a breakfast of coffee, bacon and bread.
Afterwards they smoked, and Rocco talked. Hugh
watched him in admiration. Never had he seen such a
perfect man. He was tall, strong and springy as a
panther. He had ebony black hair, and a clipped beard
and moustache, which did not conceal the strength and
character of his face. His fine lips had a haughty twist
and his dark eyes were full of stormy fire. He moved with
grace, carrying himself like a king.</p>

<p>“You must stay here for some days,” he told Hugh.
“Rest your nerves. I am glad of a guest. With me you
will be safe.”</p>

<p>He rose, looked keenly over the mountain side, then
came slowly back.</p>

<p>“I see no more shadows. For a time at least we have
driven off your wolves. Who are they?”</p>

<p>Hugh gave an account of the fight at the inn. When
he came to the death of Pascal, Rocco’s face grew dark.</p>

<p>“They killed him, the devils! My good friend, Père
Pascal. And who is there then to avenge him? You know,
here in Corsica, a life must pay for a life. I had no wish
to kill another man. There has been too much killing.
But my friend ... my old friend ... well, we will see.”</p>

<p>After that Rocco grew restless. He strode up and down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[387]</span>
the cave, constantly stopping at the door to stare out.
At last he said to Hugh:</p>

<p>“If you do not mind being alone, I will go down into
the forest. If any one should come, you must retreat
by the passage to the left. In case you want to sleep I
will show you where you will be safe.”</p>

<p>A jut of rock nearly closed the passage, but further
on it opened out again. At the end of fifty yards it
appeared to come to a stop. Rocco held up the light
he carried, and showed Hugh a cleft high up in the
rock. It was lined with furs and formed a kind of natural
bunk.</p>

<p>“Here is where I sleep when the gendarmes are in the
neighbourhood. You will be safe here. If you should be
further pursued, you have only to roll over that boulder
at the far end. Under it you will find a hole down
which you can lower yourself. It leads to a subterranean
gallery which has many branches and where no one can
find you. Only be careful not to get lost. And the boulder
too,—I fear it may be heavy for you to move. But
I do not expect to be long absent. In the meantime I do
not think any one will trouble you.”</p>


<h4>3.</h4>

<p>As he descended the mountain, the bandit kept well
under cover. Hugh watched him till he disappeared into
the forest. From the mouth of the cave a magnificent
panorama outspread. The mountains looked as if they
had been hacked out by an angry god. Their flanks were
naked. Moving cloud masses scarfed them for a moment,
only to be rent aside again, and reveal new vistas of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[388]</span>
desolation. The vast abyss of the valley was packed with
pines.</p>

<p>The time passed slowly and Rocco seemed to be long
in returning. At noon Hugh relit the fire and cooked
himself some food. He found that one of the <i>banquettes</i>
was stored with provisions, the other with clothes.
Rocco had things well arranged.</p>

<p>When he had finished eating, he let the little fire go
out, and sat gazing over the valley, dreaming away the
hours.... Margot would be married on the seventeenth,
that day week. The thought made him miserable. He
felt he would give anything to prevent the marriage. He
tried to analyze his feelings. He wanted her and yet he
did not want her. He wanted her because another man
wanted her; or rather, while he didn’t want her himself,
he did not want any one else to get her,—a most dog-in-the-mangerish
feeling. He told himself that it had all
worked out for the best. She would probably be happier
with the other man. He envied him. Margot was a
jewel of a girl, sweet, gentle, devoted. She would make a
ripping little wife. He was sorry he did not love her, at
least not in the mad, passionate way that mattered. He
just couldn’t care for people in that crazy, headlong
fashion. He was a cool, unsentimental sort of a chap.
Or was he, really?...</p>

<p>Heigh ho! the time was long. What was keeping Rocco?
What a pity about that man, condemned to pass the rest
of his life in a prison of infinite earth and sky. He looked
around at the few primitive comforts of the cave. There
were some books, all on political economy or sociology.
Yes, a great pity! A man of force and ability sacrificed
because of a youthful excess of ardour. His friends said
that Rocco had fired in self-defence; but the friends of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">[389]</span>
dead man were in power. All at once Hugh had an
idea, a fantastic idea. Yes, that was what he would
do....</p>

<p>Heigh ho! again. The time was infernally long. It
must be about three in the afternoon. How still the
mountain side was. Nothing moved. Suppose he slept a
little! Taking a blanket, he crawled along the dark
passage to the left, climbed up into the cleft and curled
snugly in his blanket. Heigh ho!...</p>


<h4>4.</h4>

<p>He was awakened from a sound sleep by hearing some
one moving in the outer part of the cave. The bandit
must be wondering what had become of him. He was
about to jump down from his perch and greet Rocco
when the thought came to him:</p>

<p>“Perhaps it is not he after all. I must be cautious.”</p>

<p>He crawled along the narrow passage, and peered
around the shoulder of rock that blocked its entrance.
Then he drew a deep, gasping breath, for this is what he
saw:</p>

<p>Seated on one of the oak <i>banquettes</i> was Doctor Bergius.
He was leaning forward in an attitude of fatigue;
his eyes—so wide open that their yellow pupils looked like
rings—glared at the rock behind which Hugh was peering.
Hugh thought himself discovered; fear paralyzed him.
From the darkness he stared back at the doctor. But it
was evident the doctor did not see him, did not see anything
in fact. His stare was that of abstraction; his mouth
had the twist of a savage beast; his face was set in an
expression of rage and despair.</p>

<p>Then Hugh saw Castelli, at the mouth of the cave,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">[390]</span>
looking anxiously down the mountain side. He, too,
looked weary and desperate. The third of the party was
Gamba. Gamba alone showed no sign of hardship. The
little man, compact of all that was fierce and tenacious,
was hunting round the cave like a nosing terrier. Hugh
started to draw cautiously back when suddenly he heard
a hoarse shout from Doctor Bergius.</p>

<p>“Castelli.”</p>

<p>Castelli wheeled round sharply.</p>

<p>“Well, doctor?”</p>

<p>“Castelli, you and I have got to have a heart-to-heart
talk. Here and now is a good time. Castelli, you distrust
me.”</p>

<p>The Italian started, made a gesture of protest. The
doctor strode up to him.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve noticed it for some time. The others, too.
All of you distrust me. If I thought there was anything
in the nature of a conspiracy between you, I’d blow you
to hell this instant.”</p>

<p>The doctor was glowering down at the Italian. With
a savage gesture he drew a revolver.</p>

<p>Castelli looked at him coolly.</p>

<p>“Go ahead, doctor,” he said. “As a matter of fact I
don’t distrust you, but I can’t answer for the other two.
You must admit that things aren’t very clear. You
played all the other men false. You left them stranded on
the Italian shore without a <i>sou</i> of the money. You
brought it here for us to make a divide. Then you told
us you had lost it; that it had been stolen from you by that
fool of an Englishman in a manner you must admit to be
fantastic. Can you blame them if they think you want to
bilk them, too? Now, personally, I believe you; but if
we don’t find this Englishman and recover the money, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">[391]</span>
give you fair warning there is likely to be trouble. It’s
no use threatening me, doctor. Remember we are three
against one, and none of us very squeamish about taking
life.”</p>

<p>“By God, it’s true, Castelli. I’ve been outwitted, and
by a fool. Aye, that’s what hurts. He must have spied
on me at the hotel. I could not take the bag about with
me everywhere. He profited by an hour’s absence, only
an hour, to get possession of it. He’s got it, got it all.
He’s hidden it till he can come back safely and get it away.
That’s why we’ve got to find him, got to hunt him down.
He mustn’t leave the island. He’s here somewhere in these
cursed wilds. He must not escape us. We’ve got to get
him, Castelli; and, when we do, I’ll torture him till he
tells; then kill him afterwards with my own hands. Ha!
that will be the happiest moment in my life,—when I kill
the dog.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Castelli, “we haven’t got him yet! There’s
no use wasting time; it’s evident he’s not here.”</p>

<p>“Leave no stone unturned. It was just a chance that
he might have taken refuge with this Rocco. Where is
the fellow? He might at least be able to give us some information.”</p>

<p>“Gone off hunting probably. Still he’s been here not
so long ago. See, the ashes of his fire are still hot.”</p>

<p>“We may as well go. We’ve no time to spare. Stay!
as we are here, we might as well search the place. There
are three passages. I’ll take the centre one; Gamba can
search the one to the right, while you examine the one to
the left. Got an electric torch?”</p>

<p>“No, matches.”</p>

<p>“All right. Go ahead.”</p>

<p>Feeling his way along the wall, Hugh ran back into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">[392]</span>
darkness. There was not a moment to lose; Castelli was
almost in the passage. He must escape. Ah! the boulder
that concealed the secret exit! He reached it and
tried to move it. In vain! Again he tried with all his
strength. He was able to budge it only a few inches.
Castelli was already at the opening. No, he could not
shift this cursed boulder; he would be caught like a rat
in a hole! Castelli was in the passage now, trying to light
a match. As Hugh flung himself flat against the rocky
wall, his uplifted hands came in contact with the ledge
of the cleft where he had been sleeping. Quick as thought
he drew himself up and shrank back till he was wedged into
the rock itself.</p>

<p>Castelli was fumbling and stumbling. He was striking
a fresh match every minute and swearing audibly. Hugh
saw a faint glow, then darkness, then the glow again.
Castelli did not like his job; but he was taking no chances.
Nearer and nearer he drew. Now he had come to the end
of the passage, just below Hugh’s hiding place.</p>

<p>“<i>Sapristi!</i> My last match,” Castelli muttered. He
struck it, holding it high above his head, and examined
the opposite wall. The light just came to the ledge within
a foot of Hugh’s face. Then Hugh did something for
which he was proud as long as he lived. Reaching forward,
he softly blew out the light.</p>

<p>He heard Castelli curse; but the Italian had his back to
him and did not realize where the draft had come from.</p>

<p>“There! that’s out,” he exclaimed. “But there’s nothing
here. I’m off.”</p>

<p>Hugh breathed freely again as he heard Castelli groping
his way out. He could scarcely realize his luck. On such
small things human destiny often turns. Had Castelli
possessed another match he would surely have been discovered.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">[393]</span>
He raised himself, confident of his safety, and
listened. He heard the distant voice of the doctor.</p>

<p>“No sign of any one. The passages Gamba and I examined
dwindled away in the rock.”</p>

<p>“Mine, too, came to an end,” said Castelli. “I felt the
walls all round. Not even a rat-hole.”</p>

<p>Then the voices ceased and Hugh heard the men scrambling
out of the cave.</p>


<h4>5.</h4>

<p>Darkness had fallen and still Rocco did not return.
The cave-mouth was a ring of velvety blue patterned with
stars. The air was exquisitely cold and pure. As Hugh
cowered in the darkness he wrapped himself in a blanket.
The silence was breathless, acute. Staring up at the blue
circle of sky, he listened to the beating of his heart. Then
suddenly, noiselessly, a dark form loomed up between him
and the stars. It was Rocco.</p>

<p>The bandit walked like one very weary. He threw himself
down and lit a cigarette. After he had drunk the
soup Hugh heated for him, he drew a deep sigh.</p>

<p>“You have been long,” commented Hugh.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Rocco; “I have done much, seen much,
learned much. Incidentally I have killed a man.”</p>

<p>Hugh gazed at Rocco in silence. After a deliberate
pause the bandit went on:</p>

<p>“Yes, I killed him, or was the means of his meeting his
death. I will tell you.”</p>

<p>Through the mouth of the cave came the pure air perfumed
with pines. Hugh wrapped his blanket around him
and settled down to listen. In the darkness he could see
the glowing tip of a cigarette, and from behind it hear
the roll of a rich voice.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">[394]</span>“When I left you,” said the voice, “I went to the inn. I
found the body of poor Pascal in the pool. There was a
bullet wound in the head. They must have struck him
when they fired at you. However, that does not matter.
Pascal has an enemy. The crime will be put down to the
vendetta. A convenient institution, the vendetta; it covers
a multitude of sins.”</p>

<p>There was a reflective pause. The cigarette glowed and
faded; then the sonorous voice went on:</p>

<p>“I took my poor dead friend out of the water and carried
him into the kitchen of the inn. I laid him on the
table, straightened his limbs, folded his hands over his
breast, and put a crucifix between them. Then I knelt
down and said a prayer for the welfare of his soul....”</p>

<p>The voice was silent for a little. The round mouth of
the cave was brightening, and the stars shrinking back affrighted.
The voice grew tense.</p>

<p>“It was while I was praying that the man entered. He
saw neither myself nor the body, for the place was in
darkness. He went over to where your clothes were and
began to search them, the pockets, the lining. It was
while he was doing this that I put a pistol to his
head.”</p>

<p>A deep laugh awoke the echoes of the cave. Into its
circular mouth crept the silver edge of the moon.</p>

<p>“I never saw a man so scared. You should have seen
him jump. I backed him against the wall with his hands
high in the air. I pointed to the dead man. ‘You killed
him,’ said I. He shook his head. ‘Then,’ I said, ‘you
helped to kill him. Tell me, and I’ll give you a chance
for life. Otherwise I’ll shoot you where you stand.’ Then
he told me that he had seized and held Pascal while his
comrade had strangled him. ‘So,’ I said, ‘that was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">[395]</span>
way of it. Well, you are equally guilty, but you shall
have a chance for your life. Have you a knife?’”</p>

<p>Rocco’s cigarette went out. He took his time to light
another. The velvet circle cut the moon in half. Hugh
could see the face of Rocco now, a pale, grim, tragic face.
The bandit went on:</p>

<p>“‘Yes, I have a knife,’ answered the man. ‘And can
you use it?’ I asked. ‘None better,’ said he. I marched
him out of the place to the clearing in front of the inn.
‘Now,’ I said, ‘look ... I throw away my rifle, my pistol.
Knife to knife we will fight it out. You for your life; I
to avenge my friend. Is it well?’ And he answered me;
‘It is well.’”</p>

<p>Rocco rose and stood before Hugh. The full round
of the moon was framed in the circle of the cave-mouth.
It lit up the magnificent figure of the bandit, as he went
on:</p>

<p>“The man was a brute, but he was brave. His eyes
gleamed. I could see in them the joy of the fight. He
thought he had me. He drew a long bladed knife. I
drew mine. There in the forest we circled round, watching
each other like two cats. Suddenly he leaped. He was
holding his knife like a sword, point up to strike at the
belly. I caught his wrist as he stabbed. Then I dropped
my own weapon. I reached round him and forced his
knife hand behind his back. He was strong; I never wrestled
with a stronger. We had a tough struggle; and they
say there is not in all Corsica my match for strength.
Slowly, surely, I twisted his knife hand behind him; then
suddenly I tripped him up. He fell, fell on the point of
his own knife. It went right through his back and stuck.
He died quickly. You would not say I killed him, would
you?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">[396]</span>“No; without going into details, one might say he
stabbed himself.”</p>

<p>“That’s it. Damn details. I do not want to have another
death at my door. Well, that’s one of your enemies
settled. And the other three.... Oh, I know they came
here. I was afraid they had got you; they are hunting
for you high and low. They have horses and spies. The
stations are all guarded; the country people warned. A
dazzling price is set on your head. So much I have heard
from some wood-cutter friends of mine. Alas! my young
friend, I fear Corsica is too hot for you. The sooner you
are out of our brave little island the better.”</p>

<p>“What must I do?”</p>

<p>“There’s a boat sails for Marseilles to-morrow. You
must catch it.”</p>

<p>“But how?”</p>

<p>“I will conduct you by a secret trail through the woods
to the railway, at a point only fifteen miles from Agaccio.
After that you must take your chance. See, I have
brought your clothes from the inn. Now we will both
sleep, for we must be up at dawn; you have a long, hard
day before you. Believe me, I do not exaggerate the
danger you are in. But I will do my best for you, and
I hope you will get through. Now sleep....”</p>

<p>Hugh stretched himself out in his blanket; as he closed
his eyes, the moon sailed out of the pool of sky and the
cave was plunged in darkness.</p>

THE LAST LAP</h3>
</div>

<h4>1.</h4>

<p class="drop-cap">A LITTLE after daylight they left the cave and descended
the mountain. With Rocco leading they
plunged into the first fringe of forest and by a
a little toe-trail travelled swiftly, keeping high above the
valley. Hugh saw nothing but the sombre pine trunks.
They encountered no one and the silence was profound.
Rocco spoke little. Once or twice he stopped to listen,
then, seemingly satisfied, went on at the same rapid pace.
At noon they made a short halt for lunch.</p>

<p>They were gradually descending. The sharpness of the
mountain air had given way to a softer temperature, the
pines had yielded to oaks. At first the oaks had been
bare branched, then they were clothed with leafage.
Underfoot, too, the grey had given way to brown, the
brown in turn yielded to green. They were dropping
through the temperate zone to the warmer one of the
coast.</p>

<p>It was early afternoon when Rocco stopped and turned
to Hugh.</p>

<p>“This is as far as I dare go,” said he. “I think you can
manage alone. You must descend that path to the railway.
You will then be about fifteen miles above Agaccio.
The road almost parallels the railway. You will have to
wait to travel it until the dusk, and should get to the
town about nine o’clock. The boat leaves at ten. If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">[398]</span>
nothing happens you should catch it. Have you any
money?”</p>

<p>Hugh had not thought of that. He searched his
pockets.</p>

<p>“No, they got all.”</p>

<p>“Take this. I have no use for money as you can see.”</p>

<p>He handed Hugh a note for five hundred francs.</p>

<p>“Oh, I can’t accept that.”</p>

<p>“Come now. Consider it a loan. You will repay me
some day.”</p>

<p>“All right. But let’s sit down and have a smoke before
we separate.”</p>

<p>They flung themselves under a tree and lit their
cigarettes.</p>

<p>“Look here,” said Hugh suddenly, “what would you do
if you had a lot of money, say three million francs.”</p>

<p>Rocco showed his white teeth in a derisive smile.</p>

<p>“What would I do with three million francs? Why,
first of all I would buy my pardon; then I would go into
politics again. I would devote my life to the welfare of
Corsica. With all that money one could almost change
the destiny of our people. Ah! what a dream....”</p>

<p>“I can tell you where you will find three million francs.
You can take or leave them as you choose. Only let it be
a secret between us.”</p>

<p>“That is understood,” said Rocco gravely.</p>

<p>Hugh described where he had hidden the money, and
sketched the events which had led up to its coming into
his possession. When he had finished, Rocco sat in silence;
his eyes brooded sombrely, his brows below his lofty
forehead knitted in thought. Hugh watched his face, that
fine Roman face so full of virility and courage. Beyond
a doubt he was stirred by ambitious dreams. Hugh was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">[399]</span>
reminded of Napoleon. Might this, too, not be a man of
destiny? Suddenly Rocco roused himself.</p>

<p>“I do not know. It needs reflection. It is too stupendous.
I may take the money and use it for my country;
but if I do not, you will be sure it will remain there untouched,
perhaps forever.... But now you must be on
your way. You have far to go; see, already the sun is
declining. You must reach the Agaccio road before dusk,
and then hurry, hurry to the boat. And now good-bye.
Good luck to you.”</p>

<p>“Good-bye. I’ll never forget you.”</p>

<p>The two men shook hands with a long grip. As Hugh
turned on the downward trail, he looked back at the tall,
graceful figure of Rocco, standing erect with folded arms.
He waved his hand and Rocco took off his broad-brimmed
hat. Then a turn of the trail parted them forever.</p>


<h4>2.</h4>

<p>It seemed to Hugh that he must have taken a wrong
turning, for the trail, which had been growing less and
less defined, suddenly disappeared. He was lost in the
forest. Night was approaching. However, by keeping
on down the hill, he must eventually come to either
the road or the railway. He struck into a brisker
pace, and, as there was no underbrush, made rapid progress.
He had been descending for perhaps half an hour,
when he heard a welcome sound, the whistle of a train.
A little further on the forest lifted, and the line of railway
lay below him.</p>

<p>Less than a kilometre away, was the station; a freight
train laden with logs was drawing ponderously out. He
decided to let it pass, before continuing down the track.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">[400]</span>
He waited impatiently. It had occurred to him that
perhaps he was exposing himself too much; and he was
drawing back when he heard a shout, ... a shout of
fury and of triumph.</p>

<p>With a heart leap of fear he recognized the three men
who were hunting him. What ghastly misfortune!
They were on horseback too. Castelli, who had been
searching the hillside with a pair of powerful glasses,
had been the one to discover him. He handed the glasses
to Doctor Bergius and pointed to Hugh. At the same
instant Gamba leaped from his horse, crossed the railway
track and launched in pursuit.</p>

<p>For a dazed moment Hugh cursed his folly in thus exposing
himself, then turned and crashed back into the
brush. It was very thick and he made progress with difficulty.
At this rate he would surely be caught. Then
to his joy, he came upon a little trail that descended and
skirted the railway. He raced along it.</p>

<p>Once with panting lungs he stopped to listen. Was he
being followed? He heard a cracking of underbrush;
Gamba had taken a short cut and was appallingly near.
Hugh tore on again. The trail broke from the forest and
skirted a bluff that overhung the railway, running along it
for about three hundred yards. As Hugh came out on
this exposed stretch his heart sank. Here at last he was
surely trapped. To his right was the steep cut to the
railway, to the left the dense brush of the forest. The
only way of escape was straight ahead. If only he could
make the end of the pathway before Gamba reached him....
Well, he must do his best.</p>

<p>He had gone but a short distance when Gamba crashed
into the open. The little man was as fleet as a deer, as
sure-footed as a goat. Hugh knew he had no chance;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">[401]</span>
but with the strength of despair he pounded on. There
was a roaring in his ears. The train! It was puffing and
clanking below him. Gamba was gaining on him fast. As
he dashed on, Hugh noticed that the bluff dipped, so that
in one place it was only about ten feet above the track. If
he could make this gap, leap the track and reach the gully
that lay on the other side, there was a chance he might
yet escape. He made a desperate spurt to gain it.</p>

<p>But he had reckoned without the train. As he got to
the lowest point of the cut, it was passing just below him.
Again luck was against him. He must wait until all
those heavy wagons had lumbered by. Gamba was only
fifty yards behind him. Oh, that cursed train! Would
it never pass! But why wait? Why not ... ah! that
was an idea. Desperate, maybe, but he would stick at
nothing.... Nerving himself he leaped, and fell sprawling
on the train.</p>

<p>Fortunately he landed between two huge logs. He was
bruised and shaken, but he raised himself immediately.
He had alighted about midway in the line of wagons and
there were three others still to pass the place from which
he had jumped. Now one had passed, then the second,
then, just as the third and last wagon was rumbling
by Gamba reached the point.</p>

<p>He hesitated, stared for a moment as if confused,
then caught sight of Hugh. He looked down at the last
of the passing wagons. Was he, too, going to jump?
Hugh held his breath. No, Gamba could not
make it. That little moment of hesitation had been fatal;
even as he crouched to spring, the last wagon rolled from
beneath him.</p>

<p>Hugh heard a yell of anger. As if dumbfounded,
Gamba stood on the point of rock shaking his fists in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">[402]</span>
impotent rage at the train carelessly lumbering on its way.</p>

<p>It grew dark quite suddenly. Hugh heard the puffing
of the engine, and saw a cloud of steam with an under-glow
of orange. In spite of his bruises he was feeling
extravagantly happy. How lucky to have jumped on
the train! At the rate they were going he would be in
Agaccio in an hour. He breathed freely now. Freedom,
safety lay ahead. Soon, very soon, he would be on the
boat for Marseilles. Then ho! for Paris.... What was
the matter? They were slowing up.</p>

<p>Yes, they were stopping at a station. He hoped it
would not be a long stop. In any case he must be well
ahead of his pursuers by now ... that is, if they had not
given up the pursuit. There in the dusk he lay between
the two great logs, and once more congratulated himself
on his escape. The air was rich with the perfume of
pines, and the stars were like glow-worms in the fields of
heaven.</p>

<p>Hark! What was that? He was horribly nervous. As
he strained his ears, he fancied he heard the distant beat
of galloping hoofs. They came nearer. He heard them
drumming on the road that ran beside the railway track.
He might have known it; his enemies were racing to cut
him off. Had they arrived at the station before the train,
they could have easily captured him. What an escape!
And now they were drawing closer. When they got too
close, he would take to the forest. Then the awful nerve-racking
hunt would begin again.</p>

<p>In imagination he saw them, spurring and lashing their
horses, straining every nerve to reach the station before
the train pulled out. Would it never start? The drumming
hoofs sounded very near indeed. The engine-driver
lighted his pipe, and made some joking remark to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">[403]</span>
station master. At last, he turned and jumped up to his
cab. Thank God! the train was in motion.</p>

<p>It cleared the station and gathered speed, plunging once
more into the forest. And not a moment too soon!
Hugh looked back to see three horsemen dash into the
light, leap from their horses and run forward. Too
late!...</p>

<p>A few miles further on the train came to another halt.
Perhaps it was imagination, but Hugh thought he heard
again the sound of furious galloping. He heaved a sigh
of relief when once more they were under way.</p>

<p>Soon the lights of Agaccio appeared and the train
slowed up. Hugh jumped down and made for the harbour.
With a thrill of joy he boarded the steamer, and,
going forward, mingled with a crowd of garlic-flavoured
Corsicans.</p>

<p>When the boat cleared and blew her whistle it sounded
to him like a hoarse bellow of triumph. As she stood out
to sea he looked back at the lights of the harbour. He
fancied he still heard the galloping of exhausted horses,
and the curses of three maddened men. Perhaps they were
there now, standing on the wharf, gazing in rage and
despair after the departing steamer. He hoped they were.</p>

<p>“Corsica, farewell!” he cried. “As long as I live I’ll
never set foot on your shores again. I’m free, free once
more. And now for Paris ... Margot....”</p>

MARGOT</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">HOW strange is the romance of destiny! Four
nights before he had lain in a cave in the hinterland
of Corsica, listening to a brigand’s tale of
blood, and now, behold, he was in Paris, walking the
Boulevard Montparnasse, and searching for a certain
number.</p>

<p>He found it, an old house sandwiched between two
modern ones. Looking up to its mansarded roof he saw
a window alight, a window with a small balcony. That
must be her room. He had heard her speak of it so often,
her “Mansard of Dreams” as she called it. His heart
beat excitedly; then suddenly he saw a shadow on the
blind. Yes, it was her shadow, Margot’s. Should he
go up? He thought not. It was too late. She was probably
very busy, preparing for the morrow, her marriage
morn. No, he would not bother her to-night.</p>

<p>While he was thus arguing with himself, his feet were
carrying him to the door. A fat concierge was giving a
Pekinese spaniel an airing. Suddenly he heard himself
asking.</p>

<p>“Does Mademoiselle Leblanc live here?”</p>

<p>“Yes, monsieur. Fifth floor. Door to the right.”</p>

<p>It sounded like an invitation to go up, and he accepted
it. As he mounted the broken stairs, his heart beat faster.
Very silly this! Why should making a call on her so
excite him? It was hard to believe that she was there.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">[405]</span>
It seemed years since he had seen her,—far back in a
somewhat uncertain past.</p>

<p>He found himself at the door, knocking. How his confounded
heart was knocking too! <i>Damn!</i> He could hear
her moving about inside. Perhaps she thought it was
some one else. Perhaps when she saw it was he, she would
be disappointed. She was taking a long time to open
the door. He felt a great longing come over him, a great
tenderness. He would take her in his arms, kiss her,
overwhelm her with passionate caresses.</p>

<p>He did none of these things. When the door opened,
he was the punctilious, rather cold, young man she had always
known.</p>

<p>“Good evening,” he said politely.</p>

<p>“<i>You!</i>”</p>

<p>She stood staring at him; her blue eyes big in her pale
face; her hands up to her heart as if to still its tumult.
She wore a loose black <i>peignoir</i> that showed off by contrast
the pearly whiteness of her skin. Against the background
of her pale gold hair her face was delicately sweet.
For the hundredth time she reminded him of a lily.</p>

<p>“It is, indeed, you?”</p>

<p>She took both his hands and pulled him gently into the
room. She had pinned up her hair rather hastily, and it
came tumbling about her. As she raised her hands again
to pile it about her head, he stopped her.</p>

<p>“No, leave it like that. It was like that the first time
I saw you. I will always think of you that way.”</p>

<p>She let it fall, a shimmering cape around her.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” she said faintly, “to receive you in this
poor shabby room. Please sit down on that chair. It’s
my only one.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">[406]</span>He took it. She herself sat down on the edge of the
bed, facing him.</p>

<p>“I hurried to get here,” he told her awkwardly. “I
wanted to be present at the ceremony,—even if only as a
spectator in the background.”</p>

<p>“What ceremony?”</p>

<p>“Your wedding, to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Why, didn’t you know? I wrote to tell you I’d refused
him.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t get the letter. You refused him.... Why?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I suppose I didn’t care enough for
him. I don’t think shall ever marry.”</p>

<p>“And what are you doing now?”</p>

<p>“Working,—with Jeanne. We are taking a shop. I
thought it was she when you knocked.”</p>

<p>“Are you happy?”</p>

<p>“Yes, happier than I have ever been in my life.”</p>

<p>“And I am more miserable.”</p>

<p>“You! Why?”</p>

<p>“Because ... I’m lonely. Look here, Margot, I want
you. I only realized how much I needed you after you
went away—how much you mean to me. I say, Margot,
I suppose I’m a stiff, cold sort of a chap. I can’t do the
sentimental stuff. I can’t make pretty speeches, but I
really do care for you.”</p>

<p>“As a sister?”</p>

<p>“No, an awful lot more than that! I can’t do without
you, dear. I know it now. I knew it the moment I’d
thought I’d lost you. Don’t tell me I’ve lost you, Margot.”</p>

<p>He leaned forward, staring anxiously into her eyes.
She sat quite still, her breath coming fast.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">[407]</span>“Marry <i>me</i>, Margot,” he faltered, “Me!”</p>

<p>She seemed made of ice. “That’s very kind of you,”
she said.</p>

<p>“Not at all, Margot. Believe me, I’m not kind. I’m
humble. I’m pleading. I’ll get down on my knees if you
like.”</p>

<p>“No, please don’t.”</p>

<p>“Look here....” He suddenly leaned forward. He
took a handful of her shining hair and twisted it into a
great golden rope, then wound it around her white throat.</p>

<p>“Margot,” he said savagely, “if you don’t say yes, I’ll
strangle you right here. Say yes.”</p>

<p>“Is it to save my life I must say yes?”</p>

<p>“Your life—and mine.”</p>

<p>“Well, if it’s to save yours, too.... Yes!”</p>

<p>The tension was over. He rose. He was radiant. He
laughed.</p>

<p>“I’ll see the British Consul to-morrow; and we’ll get
hitched up in a few days. Now I’m going. I want to be
alone, to realize my happiness, to sing to the stars. I
want to celebrate, to get drunk. Margot, may I get
drunk to-night?”</p>

<p>“What!”</p>

<p>“With joy I mean. I want to sit in a café by myself
and let my happiness soak in gradually. I want to
smile like an idiot over a café crême and have people
look at me twice, and say, ‘<i>Mais ... il est fou, ce gars
la</i>....’ I want to laugh loudly at the moon, and dance
the can-can by the Carpeaux fountain. Oh Margot,
Margot....”</p>

<p>Down in the street a passing <i>sergent de ville</i> who happened
to look up at the lighted mansard window, saw two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">[408]</span>
separate shadows on the blind. The masculine shadow
reached out to the feminine one, then the two shadows
became one.</p>

<p>“<i>Ah! Ces amoureux!</i>” he remarked with a shrug as
he went on his way.</p>

AND LAST</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A YEAR later Hugh sat at his desk, reading the
following letter:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Chap</span>:</p>

<p>I wrote to you in Menton, and the letter came back.
But the other day a man in the office saw you in Paris
and gave me your address. He also gave me a very good
account of you; I am glad, for I have often felt anxious
about you. I hope now that you have again taken up
the burden of the wage-earner, you are not finding it
too heavy. I’ve become a professional ink-slinger. You
remember me as a dilettante, a trifler. I wrote whimsical
essays; I cultivated an urbane humour. Then one day in
a fantastic mood I started a burlesque of the German
spy novel. I showed it to a bloated publisher who refused
to publish it as a burlesque, but suggested that it would
go as a serious effort. He thought the public would
take it that way. The public did.</p>

<p>So now behold me, a popular author, a six shilling
shocker to my credit, another half-done, and many more
in my mental incubator.</p>

<p>Of course, on the strength of my success I resigned from
Gummage &amp; Meek. We had saved a few thousand pounds,
so if literature proves more of a staff than a crutch, we
won’t be altogether on the rocks. Better still, a preposterously
rich bachelor brother of my wife’s has promised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">[410]</span>
to see the two boys through school and college. In short,
I find at last my dream realized. I am free to cultivate
my literary cail-yaird.</p>

<p>I want now to find some quiet place where I can live in
a leisurely way, polish my gems, and generally lead a
pleasant, tolerant, contemplative life. Do you, with your
knowledge of the south of France, know of such a place?
The exchange rate now is so advantageous.</p>

<p>Please rub a little liniment on your strong right arm,
grip your pen with intense determination, and favour me
with a few lines.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">Sincerely,</span><br />

<span class="smcap">Arthur Ainger</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>Hugh looked round the shabby but comfortable room
he called his den. There was a roll-top desk, crimson-curtained
book shelves, a big easy chair by the window,
many unframed canvases on the walls. His eyes rested
on each article with loving satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Good old chap,” he said, “I’ll answer his letter right
away.”</p>

<p>So he sat down at his desk and began:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Ainger</span>:</p>

<p>I am more than ashamed that I have never written to
you; but so many things have happened. To begin with
I have a modest apartment near the Luxemburg Gardens.
I was married a year ago. My wife’s a jolly good sort.
You’d like her. I intended after my marriage to get
work of some kind, but the unexpected happened. It seems
I had a maternal grandmother living in Monaco. She
had quarrelled with my mother; and though she gave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">[411]</span>
consent to the marriage she refused to be reconciled.
When she died it was found she had left everything to me.
They had some trouble in finding me, but through the
old chap who brought me up, they eventually did.</p>

<p>I now find myself the owner of a property in the Condamine
that nets me twelve thousand francs a year, enough
for two quiet people to jog along on quite comfortably.
After all, I’ve come to the conclusion I’m one of those
simple souls who want to slip through life with as little
trouble as possible to themselves and to every one else.</p>

<p>My hobbies are cars and painting. I am the proud
possessor of a little Buggatti in which I whiz the wife out
to Barbizon occasionally. Otherwise I attend the Ecole
des Beaux Arts and am doing quite well. In time I hope
I’ll make an averagely good artist, and occasionally sell
a <i>croute</i>.</p>

<p>I am so glad to hear of your success. The sort of books
you write are the sort I like. But then I am not exacting,
and read to take my mind off the monotony of existence.
Sometimes, you know, on a wet day when one can’t paint
and there’s no billiard table, a good yarn’s not a bad
thing to pass the time. I imagine there’s a whole lot
like me.</p>

<p>By the way, you speak of finding a quiet corner where
you can hole up and live cheaply. I have a little cottage
at Villefranche which I can offer you. There’s not much
in the way of furniture, but you can stay there as long
as you like and what with the produce of a big garden
and the fish you can catch, the cost of life is reduced to a
minimum.</p>

<p>Now don’t refuse....</p>
</div>

<p>Hugh had got this far when Margot entered. He
handed her his letter to read.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">[412]</span>“Why,” she said indignantly, “you’ve left out the most
important thing of all.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I quite forgot about that.”</p>

<p>“Forgot! Listen. The precious little darling! He’s
crying for me now.”</p>

<p>“Yes, his lungs are better than his looks.”</p>

<p>“I like that. Everybody says he’s the image of you.
Now, I must run.”</p>

<p>“All right. I’ll put him in the postscript.”</p>

<p>Hugh added a few more words as he listened to the
subsiding wails of his son and heir. Then throwing himself
in his easy chair with a laugh of utter happiness he
lit his pipe.</p>


<p class="center">THE END</p>
